13,Easy,What is the rule regarding component names,They must start with a capital letter
14,Easy,How do you access a DOM element directly,Using the useRef hook
15,Easy,Can you use class as an attribute name in JSX,"No, you must use className because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript"
16,Easy,"What is ""One-way data binding""",Data flows down from parent to child via props
17,Easy,How do you export a component as the default export,export default ComponentName;
18,Easy,What is the purpose of package.json,"It tracks dependencies, scripts, and project versioning"
19,Easy,Can a parent component change the state of a child component directly,"No, not directly; it must pass data via props or use a ref"
20,Easy,How do you comment out code inside JSX,{/* This is a comment */}
21,Medium,"Explain ""Lifting State Up""",Moving shared state to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it
22,Medium,What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect,useEffect runs asynchronously after the render is painted to the screen; useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after DOM mutations but before the paint
23,Medium,"What is a ""Controlled Component""",An input form element whose value is controlled by React state (single source of truth)
24,Medium,What is the purpose of React.memo,"It is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component, preventing re-renders if props haven't changed"
25,Medium,"How do you create a ""Custom Hook""","By creating a JavaScript function whose name starts with ""use"" and that calls other hooks"
26,Medium,What is the issue with using an array index as a key,It can negatively impact performance and cause issues with component state if the list order changes
27,Medium,What is the cleanup function in useEffect,A function returned by the effect that runs before the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs
28,Medium,What is useReducer used for,It is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic involving multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one
29,Medium,"How do you implement ""Lazy Loading"" in React",Using React.lazy() and wrapping the component in <Suspense>
30,Medium,"What is the ""Rules of Hooks""",Hooks can only be called at the top level (not inside loops/conditions) and only from React functions
31,Medium,How do you force a component to re-render,By changing its state or props
32,Medium,What is the difference between Link (from React Router) and a standard <a> tag,Link updates the URL and renders the new view without reloading the page; <a> causes a full page refresh
33,Medium,How do you handle error boundaries in functional components,You can't directly; you must use a Class component or a library like react-error-boundary
34,Medium,"What is ""Batching"" in React",React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance
35,Medium,How do you pass a parameter to an event handler,Using an arrow function
36,Medium,What is the significance of the key prop,"It helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, optimizing the reconciliation process"
37,Medium,What is the difference between super() and super(props) in class components,super(props) allows you to access this.props inside the constructor; super() alone does not
38,Medium,Can you use async/await directly in the useEffect callback,"No, because useEffect expects a cleanup function or nothing returned, but async functions return a Promise. You must define an async function inside the effect and call it"
39,Medium,"How do you implement a ""Dark Mode"" toggle",Typically using a Context provider to hold the theme state and passing the current theme to styled components or CSS classes
40,Medium,"Explain ""Dependency Injection"" in the context of React","Passing services or data sources as props (or via Context) rather than importing them directly, making components easier to test"
41,Hard,"Explain the React ""Fiber"" architecture","It is the internal reconciliation engine in React 16+ that enables incremental rendering, allowing React to pause, abort, or prioritize work."
42,Hard,"What is ""Reconciliation""",The process of diffing the Virtual DOM with the previous one to determine the most efficient way to update the Real DOM
43,Hard,"How does React handle ""Synthetic Events""",React uses a single global event listener (Event Delegation) at the root and wraps native browser events in a cross-browser wrapper called SyntheticEvent
44,Hard,"What is ""Concurrent Mode""",A set of features that help React apps stay responsive by rendering trees without blocking the main thread
45,Hard,How does Server-Side Rendering (SSR) differ from Static Site Generation (SSG) in the context of Hydration,SSR builds HTML on-demand per request; SSG builds it at compile time. Hydration is the client-side process where React attaches listeners to that pre-rendered HTML
46,Hard,"What is the ""Tearing"" problem in UI",A visual inconsistency where the UI shows different values for the same state simultaneously
47,Hard,"What is ""Suspense"" and how does it work internally","Suspense allows components to ""wait"" for something (like data) before rendering. Internally, the child component throws a Promise, which React catches to show a fallback until the Promise resolves"
48,Hard,Why shouldn't you update state during rendering,It causes an infinite loop of re-renders
49,Hard,What is the difference between React.createElement and JSX,JSX is syntactic sugar that gets compiled (transpiled) into React.createElement calls
50,Hard,"Explain ""Inversion of Control"" in React","Instead of a component controlling its child's logic, it accepts a ""render prop"" or function child, giving control back to the consumer of the component"
51,Hard,"What is ""Automatic Batching"" in React 1","React 18 batches state updates inside promises, timeouts, and native event handlers, which previous versions did not do"
52,Hard,"How do you implement an ""Error Boundary"" that catches async errors",Standard Error Boundaries do not catch async errors. You must implement a custom global error handler or use window.onerror / unhandledrejection listeners
53,Hard,"What is the ""Higher-Order Component"" (HOC) naming convention","HOCs usually start with with (e.g., withRouter, withAuth)"
54,Hard,"What is ""Portals"" event bubbling behavior","Even if a portal renders outside the parent DOM, the React event tree still propagates events to the React parent component, not the DOM parent"
55,Hard,How do you optimize a context that changes frequently,"Use libraries like Recoil/Zustand, or optimize by memoizing the Context value and splitting Contexts"
56,Hard,"What is the ""Dispatcher"" in React internals",The internal mechanism that keeps track of which hook implementation (mount vs update) should be used during rendering
57,Hard,"Explain the ""Observer Pattern"" in Redux","The Store holds state; the View subscribes to the Store; when state changes, the Store notifies all subscribers to update"
58,Hard,What is the difference between hydration and rendering,Rendering creates DOM nodes from scratch; Hydration attaches event listeners to existing DOM nodes generated by the server
59,Hard,How can you memoize a component that accepts a React Node (children) as a prop,It is difficult because children is essentially a new object/array on every render. You often shouldn't memoize wrapper components for this reason
60,Hard,"What is ""Tree Shaking""",A build optimization step (usually by bundlers like Webpack/Rollup) that removes unused code from the final bundle
