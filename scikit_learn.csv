Examples include scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and reducing dimensionality. Transformers are commonly chained together using pipelines."
8,Easy,What does train_test_split() do?,train_test_split() splits a dataset into training and testing subsets. This helps evaluate how well a model generalizes to unseen data and prevents misleading performance caused by testing on training data.
9,Medium,What is supervised learning?,"Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where models are trained on labeled data. Each input sample has a corresponding output label, allowing the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs and make predictions on new data."
10,Hard,Explain the bias–variance tradeoff.,"Bias refers to errors caused by overly simple models that underfit the data, while variance refers to errors caused by overly complex models that overfit the training data. A good model balances bias and variance, often using techniques like regularization and cross-validation."
11,Medium,What is cross-validation?,"Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate model performance by dividing the dataset into multiple folds. The model is trained on some folds and validated on others, providing a more reliable estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data."
12,Easy,What is a feature in machine learning?,A feature is an individual measurable property or variable in the dataset that represents input information used by a machine learning model to make predictions.
13,Hard,What is a Pipeline in scikit-learn and why is it important?,A Pipeline allows chaining multiple preprocessing steps and a final estimator into a single object. It ensures that the same transformations are applied consistently during training and inference and helps prevent data leakage in cross-validation.
14,Medium,What is the difference between classification and regression?,"Classification predicts discrete class labels, such as spam or not spam, while regression predicts continuous numerical values, such as prices or temperatures."
15,Easy,What is a target variable?,The target variable is the output value that a supervised learning model aims to predict based on input features.
16,Hard,What is data leakage and why is it dangerous?,Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training set is used during model training. This leads to overly optimistic performance metrics and poor real-world generalization. Using pipelines and proper validation helps prevent it.
17,Medium,What is StandardScaler?,StandardScaler standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling them to unit variance. This is important for algorithms like SVM and KNN that are sensitive to feature scale.
18,Easy,What is normalization?,"Normalization rescales feature values to a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1. It improves numerical stability and model convergence for certain algorithms."
19,Hard,Difference between normalization and standardization?,"Normalization scales data to a fixed range, while standardization centers data around zero with unit variance. The choice depends on the algorithm and data distribution."
20,Medium,What is OneHotEncoder?,OneHotEncoder converts categorical variables into binary numeric columns so that machine learning algorithms can process them effectively.
21,Easy,What is unsupervised learning?,"Unsupervised learning finds patterns or structures in unlabeled data, such as clusters or hidden relationships, without predefined output labels."
22,Hard,Explain K-Means clustering and its limitations.,"K-Means groups data into K clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance. Its limitations include sensitivity to initial centroids, difficulty handling non-spherical clusters, and the need to specify K in advance."
23,Medium,What is PCA in scikit-learn?,Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features into orthogonal components capturing maximum variance while reducing dimensionality.
24,Easy,What does fit_transform() do?,"fit_transform() first learns parameters from the data and then applies the transformation in a single step, commonly used with transformers."
25,Hard,How does scikit-learn handle missing values?,"Scikit-learn provides tools like SimpleImputer to handle missing values using strategies such as mean, median, or most frequent values, ensuring models can train without errors."
26,Medium,What is a confusion matrix?,"A confusion matrix summarizes classification results by showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping analyze model performance in detail."
27,Easy,What is accuracy?,Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made by a model.
28,Hard,Why is accuracy not suitable for imbalanced datasets?,"In imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be misleading because a model may predict the majority class most of the time and still achieve high accuracy while performing poorly on minority classes."
29,Medium,What are precision and recall?,"Precision measures how many predicted positives are correct, while recall measures how many actual positives were correctly identified."
30,Easy,What is F1-score?,"F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric when both false positives and false negatives matter."
31,Hard,Explain ROC curve and AUC.,"The ROC curve plots true positive rate against false positive rate at different thresholds, while AUC measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes."
32,Medium,What is GridSearchCV?,GridSearchCV performs exhaustive hyperparameter tuning by evaluating all parameter combinations using cross-validation to find the best model configuration.
