QuestionID,Difficulty,Question,Answer
JAVAE001,Easy,So first tell me what exactly is Java and where you have used it,Java is basically an object oriented programming language and I mostly use it to build backend logic and small applications and it runs on JVM so it works on any system
JAVAE002,Easy,Ok so when you write Java code how does it actually run in the system,First Java compiler converts code into bytecode and then JVM runs that bytecode
JAVAE003,Easy,Why people say Java is platform independent,Because Java does not run directly on OS it runs on JVM and JVM is available for every OS
JAVAE004,Easy,Can you explain what JVM actually does,JVM executes bytecode and also manages memory and handles garbage collection
JAVAE005,Easy,You must have heard JDK and JRE so what is the real difference,JDK is used to write and compile code and JRE is only used to run Java programs
JAVAE006,Easy,If I install JDK do I still need JRE,JDK already contains JRE so we do not need to install it separately
JAVAE007,Easy,While coding in Java what basic data types you usually use,I mostly use int float double char and boolean
JAVAE008,Easy,In Java everything is object but still we have primitives so why is that,Primitives are there for performance and memory efficiency
JAVAE009,Easy,So tell me what is a class in your own words,Class is like a blueprint which defines what an object will have and what it can do
JAVAE010,Easy,Then what exactly is an object,Object is a real instance of a class which we actually use in program
JAVAE011,Easy,Why Java program always starts from main method,Because JVM looks for main method first to start execution
JAVAE012,Easy,Why main method is static in Java,So that JVM can call it without creating object
JAVAE013,Easy,When you create object what method is called automatically,Constructor is called automatically when object is created
JAVAE014,Easy,Can you tell me what constructor is used for,Constructor is used to initialize object variables
JAVAE015,Easy,Can we write more than one constructor in a class,Yes we can do constructor overloading by using different parameters
JAVAE016,Easy,You have used this keyword so why do we actually need it,This keyword is used to refer current object and to avoid confusion between variables
JAVAE017,Easy,So tell me what is inheritance and why do we use it,Inheritance is used to reuse code and access parent class features in child class
JAVAE018,Easy,In simple words what is polymorphism,Polymorphism means same method behaves differently in different situations
JAVAE019,Easy,What is the difference between overloading and overriding,Overloading is same method name in same class and overriding is redefining parent method in child class
JAVAE020,Easy,Why do we make variables private in class,To protect data and achieve encapsulation
JAVAE021,Easy,So how do you access private variables then,We use getters and setters to access private variables
JAVAE022,Easy,Have you used interface If yes why,Yes interface is used when we want to define a rule that classes must follow
JAVAE023,Easy,What is the use of abstract class in real projects,It is used when we want to share common code and also force child class to implement some methods
JAVAE024,Easy,Why Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes,To avoid confusion and complexity like diamond problem
JAVAE025,Easy,So how Java achieves multiple inheritance,By using interfaces
JAVAE026,Easy,What is package and why we use it,Package is used to organize code and avoid class name conflicts
JAVAE027,Easy,When you write static keyword what does it mean,It means that variable or method belongs to class not to object
JAVAE028,Easy,So where have you used static in your code,I have used static in main method and utility methods
JAVAE029,Easy,What is final keyword and where do you use it,Final is used when we do not want to change variable or override method or extend class
JAVAE030,Easy,While running program have you seen errors so what is exception,Exception is a runtime problem that stops normal flow of program
JAVAE031,Easy,So how do you usually handle exceptions in your code,We use try catch block to handle exceptions
JAVAE032,Easy,What is finally block and when it is useful,Finally block is used to write cleanup code and it always runs
JAVAE033,Easy,You use String a lot so what exactly is String in Java,String is an object that represents sequence of characters
JAVAE034,Easy,People say String is immutable so what does that mean,It means once created we cannot change its value
JAVAE035,Easy,So why Java made String immutable,For security memory saving and thread safety
JAVAE036,Easy,What is the difference between == and equals in real usage,Double equal checks reference and equals checks actual content
JAVAE037,Easy,When do you use array in your program,When I need to store multiple values of same type
JAVAE038,Easy,If you want to repeat something many times what do you use,We use loops like for and while
JAVAE039,Easy,So when do you prefer for loop and when while loop,If I know number of iterations I use for loop otherwise while loop
JAVAE040,Easy,In loop what is use of break and continue,Break stops loop and continue skips current iteration
JAVAE041,Easy,Can you explain what this code will print int a=5 System.out.println(a++),It will print 5 because first value is used then it is increased to 6
JAVAE042,Easy,What will be output of this code int a=5 System.out.println(++a),It will print 6 because value is increased first and then printed
JAVAE043,Easy,Can you tell me what happens in this code int a=10 int b=20 a=b System.out.println(a),It will print 20 because value of b is assigned to a
JAVAE044,Easy,What will this code print String s1=new String(hello) String s2=new String(hello) System.out.println(s1==s2),It will print false because both references point to different objects
JAVAE045,Easy,Explain this code String s1=hello String s2=hello System.out.println(s1==s2),It will print true because both refer to same string from string pool
JAVAE046,Easy,What will happen in this code int arr[]=new int[5] System.out.println(arr[0]),It will print 0 because default value of int array is zero
JAVAE047,Easy,Can you explain this loop for int i=0 i<5 i++ System.out.println(i),It will print numbers from 0 to 4 because loop runs until i is less than 5
JAVAE048,Easy,What will this code do int i=0 while(i<3){ System.out.println(i) i++; },It will print 0 1 2 and then loop will stop
JAVAE049,Easy,What error will this code throw int a=10 int b=0 System.out.println(a/b),It will throw ArithmeticException because division by zero is not allowed
JAVAE050,Easy,Can you explain this code if(true){ System.out.println(Hello); },This code will give compile time error because Hello is not in quotes
JAVAE051,Easy,What will happen if we run this code String s=null System.out.println(s.length()),It will throw NullPointerException because we are calling method on null
JAVAE052,Easy,Explain this code int a=5 int b=5 System.out.println(a==b),It will print true because both values are same
JAVAE053,Easy,What will be output of this code int x=1 x+=2 System.out.println(x),It will print 3 because x becomes 1 plus 2
JAVAE054,Easy,Can you explain this code int a=3 int b=4 System.out.println(a>b),It will print false because 3 is not greater than 4
JAVAE055,Easy,What will this code print int arr[]={1 2 3} System.out.println(arr.length),It will print 3 because array has three elements


JAVAM001,Medium,So can you explain what exactly happens in memory when you create an object in Java,When we create an object first memory is allocated in heap then constructor is called and reference is stored in stack and after that we can use that object in program
JAVAM002,Medium,Many people talk about heap and stack so can you explain how both are used in real execution,Stack is mainly used for method calls and local variables and heap is used to store objects and when method finishes stack memory is cleared but heap object stays until garbage collection
JAVAM003,Medium,You said String is immutable so what actually happens if we try to change a String,When we try to change a String Java creates a new object and old one remains unchanged and reference is updated to new object
JAVAM004,Medium,So where exactly these String objects are stored in memory,Strings are stored in heap and there is also a special area called String pool to reuse same values
JAVAM005,Medium,In real projects why do people prefer StringBuilder over String,Because StringBuilder is mutable and when we modify string many times it does not create new objects again and again so it is faster and uses less memory
JAVAM006,Medium,Can you explain garbage collection in your own words,Garbage collection means Java automatically removes objects which are no longer used so that memory can be freed and program does not crash due to memory issue
JAVAM007,Medium,So how does JVM decide which object should be removed,JVM checks which objects are not reachable by any reference and those objects become eligible for garbage collection
JAVAM008,Medium,Why do we need wrapper classes in Java,Wrapper classes are needed when we want to treat primitive values like objects such as when working with collections
JAVAM009,Medium,You might have heard autoboxing so can you explain what problem it solves,Autoboxing automatically converts primitive to object and unboxing converts object to primitive so developer does not need to do it manually
JAVAM010,Medium,If I ask you when to use ArrayList and when LinkedList what will you say,If we need fast access by index we use ArrayList and if we do many insert and delete operations we prefer LinkedList
JAVAM011,Medium,So tell me how HashMap actually stores data internally,HashMap stores data in key value form and it uses hashcode of key to decide where to store the value in memory
JAVAM012,Medium,What kind of problems you faced with HashMap in multithreading,HashMap is not thread safe so sometimes data can become inconsistent if multiple threads modify it at same time
JAVAM013,Medium,Then how do you solve that problem in real projects,We use synchronized map or ConcurrentHashMap to make it thread safe
JAVAM014,Medium,So what is the main difference between HashMap and HashTable in practice,HashMap is not synchronized and faster while HashTable is synchronized and slower so mostly we use HashMap
JAVAM015,Medium,Can you explain what Set interface is used for with some real usage,Set is used when we want unique values only such as storing unique user ids or unique emails
JAVAM016,Medium,When you want to sort objects how do you usually do that,We use Comparable when we want default sorting and Comparator when we want custom sorting logic
JAVAM017,Medium,Can you explain multithreading in simple words,Multithreading means running multiple tasks at same time so that CPU is used efficiently
JAVAM018,Medium,What is the real difference between process and thread in practical sense,Process is an independent running program and thread is a small part of that program which shares memory
JAVAM019,Medium,So how do you usually create thread in Java project,We either extend Thread class or implement Runnable interface and then start the thread
JAVAM020,Medium,What problem does synchronization actually solve,Synchronization makes sure that only one thread can access critical code at a time so data remains consistent
JAVAM021,Medium,Have you heard about deadlock so what exactly happens in that case,Deadlock happens when two threads wait for each other resources and none of them can continue
JAVAM022,Medium,So how can you avoid deadlock in your code,We can avoid deadlock by proper ordering of locks and by not holding multiple locks unnecessarily
JAVAM023,Medium,Can you explain exception hierarchy in Java in simple way,All exceptions come under Throwable and then we have Exception and Error and under Exception we have checked and unchecked exceptions
JAVAM024,Medium,In real projects when do you use throws keyword,We use throws when we want to pass exception responsibility to the calling method
JAVAM025,Medium,Then why do we use throw keyword,Throw is used when we want to manually create and send an exception in code
JAVAM026,Medium,People ask about final finally and finalize so can you explain it in simple way,Final is used for restriction finally is used with try catch and finalize is a method called before object is removed
JAVAM027,Medium,Have you used marker interface If yes what is the idea behind it,Marker interface does not have methods but it gives special information to JVM like Serializable
JAVAM028,Medium,If I copy one object into another what exactly happens,If we do shallow copy only reference is copied and if we do deep copy then actual object data is copied
JAVAM029,Medium,So what is the real use of clone method,Clone method is used to create a copy of existing object without writing much code
JAVAM030,Medium,Why volatile keyword is used in multithreading,Volatile makes sure that value is always read from main memory and not from thread local cache
JAVAM031,Medium,What is enum and where have you used it,Enum is used when we have fixed set of values such as status or roles in application
JAVAM032,Medium,Why do we use static block sometimes,Static block is used to initialize static data when class is loaded
JAVAM033,Medium,What is instance block and when it runs,Instance block runs before constructor whenever object is created
JAVAM034,Medium,So in your opinion when to use abstract class and when interface,We use interface when we need multiple inheritance and abstract class when we want to share some common code
JAVAM035,Medium,Can you explain composition in real project terms,Composition means one class uses another class object to perform some work
JAVAM036,Medium,What is aggregation and how is it different from composition,Aggregation is a weak relationship where objects can exist independently
JAVAM037,Medium,Have you ever seen ConcurrentModificationException so why it happens,It happens when we modify collection while iterating using normal iterator
JAVAM038,Medium,So how do you avoid that exception,We can use iterator remove method or use concurrent collections
JAVAM039,Medium,Why Optional class was introduced in Java,Optional is used to avoid NullPointerException and force developer to handle null properly
JAVAM040,Medium,Have you used Stream API so what benefit it gives,Stream API makes code cleaner and helps in processing collection data in functional style
JAVAM041,Medium,Can you explain what will happen in this code List list=new ArrayList list.add(1) list.add(1.5) System.out.println(list),It will print both values because ArrayList stores Object type and allows mixed data types
JAVAM042,Medium,What will be output of this code String s=hello s.concat(world) System.out.println(s),It will print hello because String is immutable and concat creates new object but reference is not changed
JAVAM043,Medium,Explain this code StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder(hi) sb.append(bye) System.out.println(sb),It will print hibye because StringBuilder is mutable and modifies same object
JAVAM044,Medium,What will happen in this code int arr[]=new int[3] arr[5]=10 System.out.println(arr[0]),It will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because index 5 does not exist
JAVAM045,Medium,Can you explain this code try{ int a=10 int b=0 System.out.println(a/b) } catch(Exception e){ System.out.println(error) },It will print error because exception occurs and catch block handles it
JAVAM046,Medium,What will be output of this code Integer a=100 Integer b=100 System.out.println(a==b),It will print true because small integers are cached by JVM
JAVAM047,Medium,What will be output of this code Integer a=200 Integer b=200 System.out.println(a==b),It will print false because values outside cache range create different objects
JAVAM048,Medium,Explain this code static{ System.out.println(hello); } main method prints nothing,It will print hello because static block runs when class is loaded before main
JAVAM049,Medium,What will happen in this code class Test{ Test(){ this(); } },It will cause infinite constructor call and result in StackOverflowError
JAVAM050,Medium,Explain this code Object o=new String(hi) System.out.println(o instanceof String),It will print true because object is actually holding String
JAVAM051,Medium,What will be output of this code for(int i=0;i<3;i++){ } System.out.println(i),It will give compile error because i is not visible outside loop
JAVAM052,Medium,Explain this code List list=new ArrayList list.add(null) list.add(null) System.out.println(list.size()),It will print 2 because list allows multiple null values
JAVAM053,Medium,What will happen in this code Map map=new HashMap map.put(null 1) map.put(null 2) System.out.println(map.size()),It will print 1 because HashMap allows only one null key
JAVAM054,Medium,Explain this code try{ System.exit(0); } finally{ System.out.println(end); },Finally will not run because JVM exits before it can execute
JAVAM055,Medium,What will be output of this code String s1=hello String s2=s1 s2=world System.out.println(s1),It will print hello because changing s2 reference does not change s1


JAVAH001,Hard,Your application is getting OutOfMemoryError so how will you start debugging this,First I will check which area is running out of memory then I will analyze heap dump and see which objects are growing and then I will check why those objects are not getting released and fix the reference issue
JAVAH002,Hard,What exactly happens inside JVM when a method is called,When a method is called a new stack frame is created in stack and local variables are stored there and when method finishes that stack frame is removed
JAVAH003,Hard,If garbage collection is automatic then why do memory leaks still happen,Memory leaks happen when objects are still referenced even though we do not need them so garbage collector cannot remove them
JAVAH004,Hard,How do you decide whether to use strong reference or weak reference,If object must stay in memory I use strong reference and if it is cache like data then I use weak reference so GC can remove it
JAVAH005,Hard,Your HashMap is behaving slow when data grows so what can be the reason,It can be because of too many collisions or bad hashcode implementation or frequent resizing
JAVAH006,Hard,What actually happens when HashMap resizes,When HashMap reaches threshold it creates a bigger array and rehashes all existing entries which is costly operation
JAVAH007,Hard,Why is it dangerous to override equals without overriding hashCode,If both are not consistent then HashMap and HashSet will not work correctly and data may not be found
JAVAH008,Hard,In multithreading project how do you decide what code should be synchronized,Only the critical section which modifies shared data should be synchronized to avoid performance issues
JAVAH009,Hard,If synchronization is slowing down your program what alternatives can you think of,We can use concurrent collections atomic classes or reduce lock scope
JAVAH010,Hard,Can you explain what happens in deadlock situation with simple example,Thread A holds lock one and waits for lock two and Thread B holds lock two and waits for lock one so both wait forever
JAVAH011,Hard,How do you detect deadlock in running application,We can use thread dump and analyze blocked threads or use monitoring tools
JAVAH012,Hard,What is difference between notify and notifyAll in real usage,Notify wakes one waiting thread and notifyAll wakes all waiting threads which is safer in complex systems
JAVAH013,Hard,Why double checked locking was broken earlier and how it is fixed now,Earlier because of instruction reordering it was unsafe but with volatile keyword it works correctly now
JAVAH014,Hard,What is happens before relationship in multithreading,It guarantees that changes made by one thread are visible to another thread in correct order
JAVAH015,Hard,When do you prefer Runnable over Thread class,We prefer Runnable because Java does not support multiple inheritance and it separates task from thread
JAVAH016,Hard,Your CPU usage is high but memory is fine so what kind of issues you will suspect,I will suspect infinite loops busy waiting or too many threads doing active work
JAVAH017,Hard,What is thread starvation and how it happens,Thread starvation happens when some threads never get CPU time because other threads always take priority
JAVAH018,Hard,Can you explain difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock,Synchronized is simpler but ReentrantLock gives more control like try lock and fairness option
JAVAH019,Hard,Why wait and notify must be called inside synchronized block,Because they work on object monitor and without lock it will throw exception
JAVAH020,Hard,What is class loader and why it is important,Class loader loads classes into JVM and it helps in security and separation of namespaces
JAVAH021,Hard,Your application works locally but fails in server so what could be class loading issue,It can be because of different versions of libraries or classpath conflict
JAVAH022,Hard,What is reflection and why it should be used carefully,Reflection allows accessing private data and methods at runtime and it is slow and can break encapsulation
JAVAH023,Hard,Have you faced performance issue due to excessive object creation so how did you fix it,We reduced object creation by reusing objects and using pooling where possible
JAVAH024,Hard,Why immutable objects are automatically thread safe,Because their state never changes so multiple threads can use them without synchronization
JAVAH025,Hard,What problem does ThreadLocal solve in real applications,ThreadLocal gives each thread its own copy of variable so no synchronization is needed
JAVAH026,Hard,What is difference between fail fast and fail safe iterator in practice,Fail fast throws exception on modification and fail safe works on copy so it does not throw exception
JAVAH027,Hard,What happens if exception is thrown inside static block,Class will fail to load and program may crash
JAVAH028,Hard,How do you design custom exception and when do you use it,We create custom exception when we want to represent business specific error and handle it properly
JAVAH029,Hard,What is difference between shallow copy and deep copy in real bugs,Shallow copy causes shared data issue while deep copy creates independent objects
JAVAH030,Hard,What happens if two objects refer to each other and no one else refers them,Garbage collector can still remove them because it checks reachability not reference count
JAVAH031,Hard,Why finalize method is considered dangerous and not reliable,Because there is no guarantee when it will run and it can delay garbage collection
JAVAH032,Hard,What is memory visibility problem in multithreading,One thread changes value but other thread cannot see it because of CPU cache
JAVAH033,Hard,How volatile solves memory visibility problem,Volatile forces read and write from main memory so all threads see updated value
JAVAH034,Hard,What is difference between Callable and Runnable,Callable can return result and throw exception while Runnable cannot
JAVAH035,Hard,Your program hangs sometimes but no error is shown so how will you debug it,I will take thread dump and check blocked threads and deadlock situation
JAVAH036,Hard,What is difference between composition and inheritance in design decisions,Composition is more flexible and avoids tight coupling while inheritance is rigid
JAVAH037,Hard,Why we say favor composition over inheritance,Because composition allows changing behavior at runtime and reduces dependency
JAVAH038,Hard,What happens if hashCode always returns same value,All entries go into same bucket and HashMap becomes very slow like linked list
JAVAH039,Hard,What is happens if equals is slow and used in HashMap operations,HashMap operations become slow because equals is called frequently during lookup
JAVAH040,Hard,If you had to explain JVM to a junior what will you focus on,I will explain memory areas class loading garbage collection and how code actually runs
JAVAH041,Hard,What will happen in this code class Test{ static{ int a=10/0; } } when you run it,Class will fail to load and program will throw ExceptionInInitializerError
JAVAH042,Hard,Explain this code public static void main(String[] args){ try{ return; } finally{ System.out.println(end); } },It will print end because finally always executes even if return is called
JAVAH043,Hard,What will happen in this code class A{ A(){ foo(); } void foo(){ System.out.println(test); } int test=10; },It will print 0 because instance variables are not initialized yet when constructor runs
JAVAH044,Hard,Explain this code Map map=new HashMap map.put(new String(abc) 1) map.put(new String(abc) 2) System.out.println(map.size()),It will print 1 because equals and hashCode treat both keys as same
JAVAH045,Hard,What will happen in this code if two threads modify same HashMap at same time,It can cause data corruption or infinite loop because HashMap is not thread safe
JAVAH046,Hard,Explain this code volatile boolean flag=true while(flag){ } in multithreading context,Thread will not cache value and will always read latest value from memory
JAVAH047,Hard,What will happen in this code ExecutorService service=Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor service.submit(task) service.shutdownNow,Task may stop immediately because shutdownNow interrupts running thread
JAVAH048,Hard,Explain this code synchronized(this){ synchronized(this){ } },It will not deadlock because same thread can acquire same lock multiple times
JAVAH049,Hard,What will happen in this code Object o=new Object synchronized(o){ o.wait(); },Thread will go into waiting state and release the lock
JAVAH050,Hard,Explain this code Object o=new Object o.wait(),It will throw IllegalMonitorStateException because wait must be called inside synchronized block
JAVAH051,Hard,What will happen in this code Thread t=new Thread t.start t.start,It will throw IllegalThreadStateException because thread cannot be started twice
JAVAH052,Hard,Explain this code class Test{ public void finalize(){ System.out.println(clean); } },There is no guarantee when or if finalize will be called by JVM
JAVAH053,Hard,What will happen in this code List list=Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList()) list.add(1),It will throw UnsupportedOperationException because list is read only
JAVAH054,Hard,Explain this code class A{ static int x=10; static{ x=20; } },Final value of x will be 20 because static block runs after variable initialization
JAVAH055,Hard,What will happen in this code String s=new String(hi) s.intern(),It will put string in string pool but s will still point to heap object
