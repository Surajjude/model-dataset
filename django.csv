1,Easy,What is Django?,"Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable web applications. It follows the batteries-included philosophy by providing built-in features such as authentication, ORM, admin panel, and security mechanisms. Django encourages clean architecture, code reusability, and faster development cycles."
2,Medium,What architectural pattern does Django follow?,"Django follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. The Model manages database structure, the View handles business logic, and the Template controls presentation. Although similar to MVC, Django uses different naming conventions while keeping responsibilities clearly separated."
3,Easy,What is a Django project and a Django app?,"A Django project is the overall web application containing settings and configurations, while a Django app is a modular component that performs a specific function. Multiple apps can exist within a single project, promoting modular and reusable code."
4,Hard,Explain Django’s request–response lifecycle.,"A request first passes through middleware, then URL routing maps it to a view. The view processes logic, interacts with models, renders a template or response, which again passes through middleware before reaching the client."
5,Medium,What is Django ORM?,"Django ORM allows developers to interact with databases using Python classes instead of raw SQL. It simplifies database operations, improves security, and supports database portability."
6,Easy,What is manage.py used for?,"manage.py is a command-line utility used to run the development server, apply migrations, create superusers, and manage Django applications."
7,Hard,What are Django middlewares and why are they used?,"Middleware processes requests and responses globally. It is used for authentication, session handling, security checks, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns."
8,Medium,What are Django models?,Django models define database schema using Python classes. Each model maps to a database table and fields represent columns.
9,Easy,What is Django Admin?,Django Admin is an automatically generated interface that allows administrators to manage application data with minimal configuration.
10,Hard,How does Django handle database migrations?,"Django migrations track model changes and apply them incrementally to the database schema, ensuring consistency across environments."
11,Medium,What is a Django view?,A view is a function or class that handles web requests and returns responses containing business logic.
12,Easy,What is a URL dispatcher in Django?,The URL dispatcher maps incoming URLs to their respective views using URL patterns.
13,Hard,Explain function-based views vs class-based views.,"Function-based views are simple and straightforward, while class-based views provide reusable, extensible, and object-oriented approaches for complex logic."
14,Medium,What are Django templates?,Templates define the presentation layer using Django Template Language to render dynamic HTML content.
15,Easy,What is settings.py?,"settings.py contains all project configurations such as database settings, installed apps, middleware, and security options."
16,Hard,How does Django ensure security by default?,"Django protects against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, and password attacks through built-in security features and middleware."
17,Medium,What is QuerySet in Django?,"A QuerySet represents a lazy collection of database queries allowing filtering, ordering, and aggregation of data."
18,Easy,What is CSRF protection in Django?,CSRF protection prevents unauthorized form submissions by using secure tokens.
19,Hard,Explain Django authentication system.,"Django provides a built-in authentication system for managing users, groups, permissions, login, logout, and password security."
20,Medium,What is INSTALLED_APPS?,INSTALLED_APPS lists all Django apps enabled within the project.
21,Easy,What is a superuser in Django?,A superuser is an administrative account with full permissions and access to Django Admin.
22,Hard,How does Django handle static and media files?,"Django manages static files for CSS and JavaScript and media files for user uploads, configured separately for development and production."
23,Medium,What is pagination in Django?,Pagination splits large datasets into smaller pages to improve performance and user experience.
24,Easy,What is urls.py?,urls.py maps URL patterns to corresponding views.
25,Hard,Explain Django signals.,Signals allow decoupled components to communicate by triggering actions when certain events occur.
26,Medium,What is Django Rest Framework (DRF)?,"DRF is a toolkit for building RESTful APIs with features like serializers, authentication, and permissions."
27,Easy,What is a serializer?,A serializer converts Django model instances into JSON and vice versa for API communication.
28,Hard,Difference between select_related and prefetch_related.,"select_related uses SQL joins for foreign keys, while prefetch_related performs separate queries for many-to-many relationships."
29,Medium,What is Django middleware order?,Middleware executes in the order defined for requests and reverse order for responses.
30,Easy,What is Django shell?,Django shell is an interactive environment for testing models and queries.
31,Hard,How does Django handle caching?,"Django supports caching backends like memory, file-based, and Redis to improve performance."
32,Medium,What is a context processor?,Context processors inject variables globally into templates.
33,Easy,What is WSGI?,WSGI defines how web servers communicate with Python web applications.
34,Hard,Explain Django transactions.,Django transactions ensure atomic database operations where all changes succeed or fail together.
35,Medium,What is Form vs ModelForm?,"Form is manually defined, while ModelForm automatically generates fields from models."
36,Easy,What is makemigrations?,makemigrations generates migration files based on model changes.
37,Hard,How does Django handle concurrency?,Django handles concurrency using thread-safe request handling and database transactions.
38,Medium,What is Django context?,Context is a dictionary of data passed from views to templates.
39,Easy,What is DEBUG mode?,DEBUG mode provides detailed error pages during development and must be disabled in production.
40,Hard,How does Django support REST APIs?,Django supports REST APIs mainly through Django Rest Framework with serialization and authentication tools.
41,Medium,What is database indexing in Django?,Indexing improves query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.
42,Easy,What is collectstatic?,collectstatic gathers all static files into one directory for production.
43,Hard,What are Django permissions and groups?,"Permissions control access to actions, while groups assign permissions to multiple users."
44,Medium,What is a slug field?,A slug field stores URL-friendly text for SEO-friendly URLs.
45,Easy,What is ALLOWED_HOSTS?,ALLOWED_HOSTS specifies which domains can serve the Django application.
46,Hard,How do you deploy a Django application?,"Deployment involves configuring a web server, application server, database, static files, and environment variables."
47,Medium,What is Django testing framework?,"Django provides a testing framework based on unittest for testing models, views, and APIs."
48,Easy,What is requirements.txt?,requirements.txt lists project dependencies for consistent environments.
49,Hard,How does Django handle scalability?,"Django scales using load balancing, caching, and database optimization."
50,Easy,Why is Django suitable for large applications?,"Django promotes clean architecture, security, scalability, and rapid development."
