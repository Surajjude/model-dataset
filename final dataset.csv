Sr.no,Topic,Difficulty,Question,Answer
1,cassandra,Easy,How would you describe cassandra to someone who only knows sql,Cassandra is a distributed nosql database designed to handle massive amounts of data across many servers unlike sql it has no single point of failure and scales linearly
2,cassandra,Easy,What is the default port for cassandra,9042 for the native transport protocol
3,cassandra,Easy,What is the query language used in cassandra and is it standard sql,Cql cassandra query language and it looks very similar to sql but it doesnt support joins or subqueries
4,cassandra,Easy,How do you log into the cassandra shell,We use the cqlsh command-line interface
5,cassandra,Easy,What is a keyspace,A keyspace is the outermost container for data similar to a database in mysql or postgres it defines how data is replicated across nodes
6,cassandra,Easy,What is a node and a cluster,A node is a single machine running cassandra and a cluster is a collection of nodes that work together as one logical unit
7,cassandra,Easy,How do you see the status of your cluster,I would use the nodetool status command in the terminal
8,cassandra,Easy,Can cassandra work without a network,You can run a single node cluster for development but the whole point of cassandra is its distributed nature over a network
9,cassandra,Easy,What is nodetool describecluster ,It gives you a summary of the cluster showing the name the snitch and the partitioner being used
10,cassandra,Easy,How do you find the version of cassandra you are running,Inside cqlsh it shows at the top or i can run cassandra -v
11,cassandra,Easy,Is cassandra schema less,No it is schema optional for some things but you definitely have to define tables and columns its not like mongodb where you can just throw in any json
12,cassandra,Easy,What is the replication factor,It is the number of copies of data you want to store in the cluster if rf=3 every row is stored on three different nodes
13,cassandra,Easy,What is consistency level,the number of nodes that must acknowledge a read or write for it to be successful common levels are one quorum and all
14,cassandra,Easy,Why is denormalization okay in cassandra,Because disk space is cheap and writes are fast we favor read performance over storage efficiency
15,cassandra,Easy,Can i use aggregates like sum or avg,Yes cassandra supports basic aggregates but they only work efficiently within a single partition running them across the whole table is very slow
16,cassandra,Easy,What is the networktopologystrategy,the replication strategy we use for production it allows us to specify how many replicas we want in each specific data center
17,cassandra,Easy,What is a seed node,Seed nodes are used as contact points for new nodes joining the cluster to discover the ring topology
18,cassandra,Intermediate,Explain the concept of gossip in cassandra,gossip is a peer to peer protocol where nodes talk to each other every second to share state info like who is up who is down and who has joined the ring
19,cassandra,Intermediate,What is the partition key,It is the part of the primary key that determines data distribution all rows with the same partition key are stored together on the same physical node
20,cassandra,Intermediate,What is a clustering key,it is the second part of the primary key it determines the sorting order of the data within a partition
21,cassandra,Intermediate,Can i change my primary key after creating a table,No in cassandra data is physically stored based on the key if you need a new key you have to create a new table and migrate the data
22,cassandra,Intermediate,What is a snitch,A snitch maps the ip addresses of nodes to physical locations like datacenters and racks it helps cassandra avoid placing all replicas on the same rack
23,cassandra,Intermediate,How does cassandra handle a write operation,Actually writes are extremely fast because cassandra writes to a commit log and then a memory structure called a memtable it doesnt wait for a disk seek
24,cassandra,Intermediate,What is hinted handoff in cassandra,If a node is down during a write the coordinator node stores a hint once the target node comes back online the coordinator hands off the missed data
25,cassandra,Intermediate,How do you implement a counter column,You use the counter data type it can only be incremented or decremented you can not manually set it to a specific value
26,cassandra,Intermediate,How do you add a new node to an existing cluster,You install cassandra on the new machine point the seeds to the existing cluster and it will automatically start streaming data to balance itself
27,cassandra,Intermediate,How do you back up data in cassandra,by use the nodetool snapshot command which creates hard links to the current sstables
28,cassandra,Intermediate,Why use cassandra over mongodb,Choose cassandra for high write availability and massive scale across multiple datacenters choose mongodb if you need flexible schemas and complex document queries
29,cassandra,Intermediate,Can i use order by on any column i want in cassandra,No thats a common mistake you can only use order by on clustering columns and even then only within a single partition you can not sort data globally across the whole cluster
30,cassandra,Intermediate,What is the difference between a set and a list in cassandra,A set stores unique values and is unordered a list allows duplicates and preserves order sets are generally more performant because they dont require the internal read before write that lists often do
31,cassandra,Intermediate,How do you change the replication factor of an existing keyspace,I use alter keyspace after that i must run nodetool repair on all nodes to ensure the new replicas are created
32,cassandra,Intermediate,What is the purpose of nodetool drai,It flushes all memtables to disk and stops the node from listening to the network we usually run this before upgrading or stopping the service
33,cassandra,Intermediate,Can cassandra handle updates that increase row size,Yes but internally it just writes a new version of the row the old one is cleaned up later during compaction
34,cassandra,Intermediate,What is the smallest recommended cluster size for production,3 nodes this allows you to have a replication factor of 3 and still maintain a quorum if one node fails
35,cassandra,Advanced,Explain the read path how does cassandra find data across multiple sstables,It checks the memtable first then uses bloom filters and index summaries to quickly narrow down which sstables might contain the data on disk
36,cassandra,Advanced,What is a bloom filter,a memory efficient structure that tells you if a key definitely does not exist in an sstable it saves a lot of unnecessary disk input output
37,cassandra,Advanced,Explain anti entropy repair,it is a process run using nodetool repair that compares merkle trees between nodes to ensure all data is perfectly synchronized
38,cassandra,Advanced,How do you design a table in cassandra do you follow third normal form,Absolutely not in cassandra we use query driven modeling we design the table specifically to satisfy one query even if it means duplicating data
39,cassandra,Advanced,What happens to the data in the memtable,Once the memtable is full it is flushed to the disk into an immutable file called an sstable
40,cassandra,Advanced,Wait if sstables are immutable how do you delete data,cassandra doesnt delete data immediately it writes a marker called a tombstone during compaction the old data and the tombstone are finally purged
41,cassandra,Advanced,What is the commit log,Commit log is a crash recovery mechanism every write is logged there first if the server loses power before the memtable is flushed cassandra replays the commit log to recover data
42,cassandra,Advanced,Explain anti entropy repair,It is a process run using nodetool repair that compares merkle trees between nodes to ensure all data is perfectly synchronized
43,cassandra,Advanced,What is a merkle tree,Merkle tree is a hash tree used to find differences in data between nodes without sending the actual data over the network
44,cassandra,Advanced,What is a materialized view in cassandra, Materialized view is a table that cassandra manages automatically to allow querying the same data with a different Primary Key
45,cassandra,Advanced,What happens if a node stays down for a long time,The hints are deleted you must run a manual nodetool repair once the node comes back to ensure it gets the missed data
46,cassandra,Advanced,What is the jmx interface used for,Jmx interface used for monitoring and managing the cassandra process through tools like jconsole or prometheus
47,cassandra,Advanced,Explain multi dc replication,You can have one cluster span across two different physical datacenters cassandra handles the cross region replication automatically
48,cassandra,Advanced,How do you refresh a table after manually adding an sstable file,I use nodetool import or the older sstableloader tool
49,cassandra,Advanced,What is a custom payload in cql,It is a way for clients to send extra metadata to custom query handlers or triggers on the server side
50,cassandra,Advanced,Does cassandra support acid,It supports atomicity and isolation at the row level but it does not support multi table transactions like a sql database
51,cassandra,Advanced,When should you not use cassandra,If your data is small if you need complex joins or if your query patterns change every day cassandra is for massive predictable workloads

162,core java ,Easy,So first tell me what exactly is Java and where you have used it,Java is basically an object oriented programming language and I mostly use it to build backend logic and small applications and it runs on JVM so it works on any system
163,core java ,Easy,Ok so when you write Java code how does it actually run in the system,First Java compiler converts code into bytecode and then JVM runs that bytecode
164,core java ,Easy,Why people say Java is platform independent,Because Java does not run directly on OS it runs on JVM and JVM is available for every OS
165,core java ,Easy,Can you explain what JVM actually does,JVM executes bytecode and also manages memory and handles garbage collection
166,core java ,Easy,You must have heard JDK and JRE so what is the real difference,JDK is used to write and compile code and JRE is only used to run Java programs
167,core java ,Easy,If I install JDK do I still need JRE,JDK already contains JRE so we do not need to install it separately
168,core java ,Easy,While coding in Java what basic data types you usually use,I mostly use int float double char and boolean
169,core java ,Easy,In Java everything is object but still we have primitives so why is that,Primitives are there for performance and memory efficiency
170,core java ,Easy,So tell me what is a class in your own words,Class is like a blueprint which defines what an object will have and what it can do
171,core java ,Easy,Then what exactly is an object,Object is a real instance of a class which we actually use in program
172,core java ,Easy,Why Java program always starts from main method,Because JVM looks for main method first to start execution
173,core java ,Easy,Why main method is static in Java,So that JVM can call it without creating object
174,core java ,Easy,When you create object what method is called automatically,Constructor is called automatically when object is created
175,core java ,Easy,Can you tell me what constructor is used for,Constructor is used to initialize object variables
176,core java ,Easy,Can we write more than one constructor in a class,Yes we can do constructor overloading by using different parameters
177,core java ,Easy,You have used this keyword so why do we actually need it,This keyword is used to refer current object and to avoid confusion between variables
178,core java ,Easy,So tell me what is inheritance and why do we use it,Inheritance is used to reuse code and access parent class features in child class
179,core java ,Easy,In simple words what is polymorphism,Polymorphism means same method behaves differently in different situations
180,core java ,Easy,What is the difference between overloading and overriding,Overloading is same method name in same class and overriding is redefining parent method in child class
181,core java ,Easy,Why do we make variables private in class,To protect data and achieve encapsulation
182,core java ,Easy,So how do you access private variables then,We use getters and setters to access private variables
183,core java ,Easy,Have you used interface If yes why,Yes interface is used when we want to define a rule that classes must follow
184,core java ,Easy,What is the use of abstract class in real projects,It is used when we want to share common code and also force child class to implement some methods
185,core java ,Easy,Why Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes,To avoid confusion and complexity like diamond problem
186,core java ,Easy,So how Java achieves multiple inheritance,By using interfaces
187,core java ,Easy,What is package and why we use it,Package is used to organize code and avoid class name conflicts
188,core java ,Easy,When you write static keyword what does it mean,It means that variable or method belongs to class not to object
189,core java ,Easy,So where have you used static in your code,I have used static in main method and utility methods
190,core java ,Easy,What is final keyword and where do you use it,Final is used when we do not want to change variable or override method or extend class
191,core java ,Easy,While running program have you seen errors so what is exception,Exception is a runtime problem that stops normal flow of program
192,core java ,Easy,So how do you usually handle exceptions in your code,We use try catch block to handle exceptions
193,core java ,Easy,What is finally block and when it is useful,Finally block is used to write cleanup code and it always runs
194,core java ,Easy,You use String a lot so what exactly is String in Java,String is an object that represents sequence of characters
195,core java ,Easy,People say String is immutable so what does that mean,It means once created we cannot change its value
196,core java ,Easy,So why Java made String immutable,For security memory saving and thread safety
197,core java ,Easy,What is the difference between == and equals in real usage,Double equal checks reference and equals checks actual content
198,core java ,Easy,When do you use array in your program,When I need to store multiple values of same type
199,core java ,Easy,If you want to repeat something many times what do you use,We use loops like for and while
200,core java ,Easy,So when do you prefer for loop and when while loop,If I know number of iterations I use for loop otherwise while loop
201,core java ,Easy,In loop what is use of break and continue,Break stops loop and continue skips current iteration
202,core java ,Easy,Can you explain what this code will print int a=5 System.out.println(a++),It will print 5 because first value is used then it is increased to 6
203,core java ,Easy,What will be output of this code int a=5 System.out.println(++a),It will print 6 because value is increased first and then printed
204,core java ,Easy,Can you tell me what happens in this code int a=10 int b=20 a=b System.out.println(a),It will print 20 because value of b is assigned to a
205,core java ,Easy,What will this code print String s1=new String(hello) String s2=new String(hello) System.out.println(s1==s2),It will print false because both references point to different objects
206,core java ,Easy,Explain this code String s1=hello String s2=hello System.out.println(s1==s2),It will print true because both refer to same string from string pool
207,core java ,Easy,What will happen in this code int arr[]=new int[5] System.out.println(arr[0]),It will print 0 because default value of int array is zero
208,core java ,Easy,Can you explain this loop for int i=0 i<5 i++ System.out.println(i),It will print numbers from 0 to 4 because loop runs until i is less than 5
209,core java ,Easy,What will this code do int i=0 while(i<3){ System.out.println(i) i++; },It will print 0 1 2 and then loop will stop
210,core java ,Easy,What error will this code throw int a=10 int b=0 System.out.println(a/b),It will throw ArithmeticException because division by zero is not allowed
211,core java ,Easy,Can you explain this code if(true){ System.out.println(Hello); },This code will give compile time error because Hello is not in quotes
212,core java ,Easy,What will happen if we run this code String s=null System.out.println(s.length()),It will throw NullPointerException because we are calling method on null
213,core java ,Easy,Explain this code int a=5 int b=5 System.out.println(a==b),It will print true because both values are same
214,core java ,Easy,What will be output of this code int x=1 x+=2 System.out.println(x),It will print 3 because x becomes 1 plus 2
215,core java ,Easy,Can you explain this code int a=3 int b=4 System.out.println(a>b),It will print false because 3 is not greater than 4
216,core java ,Easy,What will this code print int arr[]={1 2 3} System.out.println(arr.length),It will print 3 because array has three elements
217,core java ,Intermediate,So can you explain what exactly happens in memory when you create an object in Java,When we create an object first memory is allocated in heap then constructor is called and reference is stored in stack and after that we can use that object in program
218,core java ,Intermediate,Many people talk about heap and stack so can you explain how both are used in real execution,Stack is mainly used for method calls and local variables and heap is used to store objects and when method finishes stack memory is cleared but heap object stays until garbage collection
219,core java ,Intermediate,You said String is immutable so what actually happens if we try to change a String,When we try to change a String Java creates a new object and old one remains unchanged and reference is updated to new object
220,core java ,Intermediate,So where exactly these String objects are stored in memory,Strings are stored in heap and there is also a special area called String pool to reuse same values
221,core java ,Intermediate,In real projects why do people prefer StringBuilder over String,Because StringBuilder is mutable and when we modify string many times it does not create new objects again and again so it is faster and uses less memory
222,core java ,Intermediate,Can you explain garbage collection in your own words,Garbage collection means Java automatically removes objects which are no longer used so that memory can be freed and program does not crash due to memory issue
223,core java ,Intermediate,So how does JVM decide which object should be removed,JVM checks which objects are not reachable by any reference and those objects become eligible for garbage collection
224,core java ,Intermediate,Why do we need wrapper classes in Java,Wrapper classes are needed when we want to treat primitive values like objects such as when working with collections
225,core java ,Intermediate,You might have heard autoboxing so can you explain what problem it solves,Autoboxing automatically converts primitive to object and unboxing converts object to primitive so developer does not need to do it manually
226,core java ,Intermediate,If I ask you when to use ArrayList and when LinkedList what will you say,If we need fast access by index we use ArrayList and if we do many insert and delete operations we prefer LinkedList
227,core java ,Intermediate,So tell me how HashMap actually stores data internally,HashMap stores data in key value form and it uses hashcode of key to decide where to store the value in memory
228,core java ,Intermediate,What kind of problems you faced with HashMap in multithreading,HashMap is not thread safe so sometimes data can become inconsistent if multiple threads modify it at same time
229,core java ,Intermediate,Then how do you solve that problem in real projects,We use synchronized map or ConcurrentHashMap to make it thread safe
230,core java ,Intermediate,So what is the main difference between HashMap and HashTable in practice,HashMap is not synchronized and faster while HashTable is synchronized and slower so mostly we use HashMap
231,core java ,Intermediate,Can you explain what Set interface is used for with some real usage,Set is used when we want unique values only such as storing unique user ids or unique emails
232,core java ,Intermediate,When you want to sort objects how do you usually do that,We use Comparable when we want default sorting and Comparator when we want custom sorting logic
233,core java ,Intermediate,Can you explain multithreading in simple words,Multithreading means running multiple tasks at same time so that CPU is used efficiently
234,core java ,Intermediate,What is the real difference between process and thread in practical sense,Process is an independent running program and thread is a small part of that program which shares memory
235,core java ,Intermediate,So how do you usually create thread in Java project,We either extend Thread class or implement Runnable interface and then start the thread
236,core java ,Intermediate,What problem does synchronization actually solve,Synchronization makes sure that only one thread can access critical code at a time so data remains consistent
237,core java ,Intermediate,Have you heard about deadlock so what exactly happens in that case,Deadlock happens when two threads wait for each other resources and none of them can continue
238,core java ,Intermediate,So how can you avoid deadlock in your code,We can avoid deadlock by proper ordering of locks and by not holding multiple locks unnecessarily
239,core java ,Intermediate,Can you explain exception hierarchy in Java in simple way,All exceptions come under Throwable and then we have Exception and Error and under Exception we have checked and unchecked exceptions
240,core java ,Intermediate,In real projects when do you use throws keyword,We use throws when we want to pass exception responsibility to the calling method
241,core java ,Intermediate,Then why do we use throw keyword,Throw is used when we want to manually create and send an exception in code
242,core java ,Intermediate,People ask about final finally and finalize so can you explain it in simple way,Final is used for restriction finally is used with try catch and finalize is a method called before object is removed
243,core java ,Intermediate,Have you used marker interface If yes what is the idea behind it,Marker interface does not have methods but it gives special information to JVM like Serializable
244,core java ,Intermediate,If I copy one object into another what exactly happens,If we do shallow copy only reference is copied and if we do deep copy then actual object data is copied
245,core java ,Intermediate,So what is the real use of clone method,Clone method is used to create a copy of existing object without writing much code
246,core java ,Intermediate,Why volatile keyword is used in multithreading,Volatile makes sure that value is always read from main memory and not from thread local cache
247,core java ,Intermediate,What is enum and where have you used it,Enum is used when we have fixed set of values such as status or roles in application
248,core java ,Intermediate,Why do we use static block sometimes,Static block is used to initialize static data when class is loaded
249,core java ,Intermediate,What is instance block and when it runs,Instance block runs before constructor whenever object is created
250,core java ,Intermediate,So in your opinion when to use abstract class and when interface,We use interface when we need multiple inheritance and abstract class when we want to share some common code
251,core java ,Intermediate,Can you explain composition in real project terms,Composition means one class uses another class object to perform some work
252,core java ,Intermediate,What is aggregation and how is it different from composition,Aggregation is a weak relationship where objects can exist independently
253,core java ,Intermediate,Have you ever seen ConcurrentModificationException so why it happens,It happens when we modify collection while iterating using normal iterator
254,core java ,Intermediate,So how do you avoid that exception,We can use iterator remove method or use concurrent collections
255,core java ,Intermediate,Why Optional class was introduced in Java,Optional is used to avoid NullPointerException and force developer to handle null properly
256,core java ,Intermediate,Have you used Stream API so what benefit it gives,Stream API makes code cleaner and helps in processing collection data in functional style
257,core java ,Intermediate,Can you explain what will happen in this code List list=new ArrayList list.add(1) list.add(1.5) System.out.println(list),It will print both values because ArrayList stores Object type and allows mixed data types
258,core java ,Intermediate,What will be output of this code String s=hello s.concat(world) System.out.println(s),It will print hello because String is immutable and concat creates new object but reference is not changed
259,core java ,Intermediate,Explain this code StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder(hi) sb.append(bye) System.out.println(sb),It will print hibye because StringBuilder is mutable and modifies same object
260,core java ,Intermediate,What will happen in this code int arr[]=new int[3] arr[5]=10 System.out.println(arr[0]),It will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because index 5 does not exist
261,core java ,Intermediate,Can you explain this code try{ int a=10 int b=0 System.out.println(a/b) } catch(Exception e){ System.out.println(error) },It will print error because exception occurs and catch block handles it
262,core java ,Intermediate,What will be output of this code Integer a=100 Integer b=100 System.out.println(a==b),It will print true because small integers are cached by JVM
263,core java ,Intermediate,What will be output of this code Integer a=200 Integer b=200 System.out.println(a==b),It will print false because values outside cache range create different objects
264,core java ,Intermediate,Explain this code static{ System.out.println(hello); } main method prints nothing,It will print hello because static block runs when class is loaded before main
265,core java ,Intermediate,What will happen in this code class Test{ Test(){ this(); } },It will cause infinite constructor call and result in StackOverflowError
266,core java ,Intermediate,Explain this code Object o=new String(hi) System.out.println(o instanceof String),It will print true because object is actually holding String
267,core java ,Intermediate,What will be output of this code for(int i=0;i<3;i++){ } System.out.println(i),It will give compile error because i is not visible outside loop
268,core java ,Intermediate,Explain this code List list=new ArrayList list.add(null) list.add(null) System.out.println(list.size()),It will print 2 because list allows multiple null values
269,core java ,Intermediate,What will happen in this code Map map=new HashMap map.put(null 1) map.put(null 2) System.out.println(map.size()),It will print 1 because HashMap allows only one null key
270,core java ,Intermediate,Explain this code try{ System.exit(0); } finally{ System.out.println(end); },Finally will not run because JVM exits before it can execute
271,core java ,Intermediate,What will be output of this code String s1=hello String s2=s1 s2=world System.out.println(s1),It will print hello because changing s2 reference does not change s1
272,core java ,Advanced,Your application is getting OutOfMemoryError so how will you start debugging this,First I will check which area is running out of memory then I will analyze heap dump and see which objects are growing and then I will check why those objects are not getting released and fix the reference issue
273,core java ,Advanced,What exactly happens inside JVM when a method is called,When a method is called a new stack frame is created in stack and local variables are stored there and when method finishes that stack frame is removed
274,core java ,Advanced,If garbage collection is automatic then why do memory leaks still happen,Memory leaks happen when objects are still referenced even though we do not need them so garbage collector cannot remove them
275,core java ,Advanced,How do you decide whether to use strong reference or weak reference,If object must stay in memory I use strong reference and if it is cache like data then I use weak reference so GC can remove it
276,core java ,Advanced,Your HashMap is behaving slow when data grows so what can be the reason,It can be because of too many collisions or bad hashcode implementation or frequent resizing
277,core java ,Advanced,What actually happens when HashMap resizes,When HashMap reaches threshold it creates a bigger array and rehashes all existing entries which is costly operation
278,core java ,Advanced,Why is it dangerous to override equals without overriding hashCode,If both are not consistent then HashMap and HashSet will not work correctly and data may not be found
279,core java ,Advanced,In multithreading project how do you decide what code should be synchronized,Only the critical section which modifies shared data should be synchronized to avoid performance issues
280,core java ,Advanced,If synchronization is slowing down your program what alternatives can you think of,We can use concurrent collections atomic classes or reduce lock scope
281,core java ,Advanced,Can you explain what happens in deadlock situation with simple example,Thread A holds lock one and waits for lock two and Thread B holds lock two and waits for lock one so both wait forever
282,core java ,Advanced,How do you detect deadlock in running application,We can use thread dump and analyze blocked threads or use monitoring tools
283,core java ,Advanced,What is difference between notify and notifyAll in real usage,Notify wakes one waiting thread and notifyAll wakes all waiting threads which is safer in complex systems
284,core java ,Advanced,Why double checked locking was broken earlier and how it is fixed now,Earlier because of instruction reordering it was unsafe but with volatile keyword it works correctly now
285,core java ,Advanced,What is happens before relationship in multithreading,It guarantees that changes made by one thread are visible to another thread in correct order
286,core java ,Advanced,When do you prefer Runnable over Thread class,We prefer Runnable because Java does not support multiple inheritance and it separates task from thread
287,core java ,Advanced,Your CPU usage is high but memory is fine so what kind of issues you will suspect,I will suspect infinite loops busy waiting or too many threads doing active work
288,core java ,Advanced,What is thread starvation and how it happens,Thread starvation happens when some threads never get CPU time because other threads always take priority
289,core java ,Advanced,Can you explain difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock,Synchronized is simpler but ReentrantLock gives more control like try lock and fairness option
290,core java ,Advanced,Why wait and notify must be called inside synchronized block,Because they work on object monitor and without lock it will throw exception
291,core java ,Advanced,What is class loader and why it is important,Class loader loads classes into JVM and it helps in security and separation of namespaces
292,core java ,Advanced,Your application works locally but fails in server so what could be class loading issue,It can be because of different versions of libraries or classpath conflict
293,core java ,Advanced,What is reflection and why it should be used carefully,Reflection allows accessing private data and methods at runtime and it is slow and can break encapsulation
294,core java ,Advanced,Have you faced performance issue due to excessive object creation so how did you fix it,We reduced object creation by reusing objects and using pooling where possible
295,core java ,Advanced,Why immutable objects are automatically thread safe,Because their state never changes so multiple threads can use them without synchronization
296,core java ,Advanced,What problem does ThreadLocal solve in real applications,ThreadLocal gives each thread its own copy of variable so no synchronization is needed
297,core java ,Advanced,What is difference between fail fast and fail safe iterator in practice,Fail fast throws exception on modification and fail safe works on copy so it does not throw exception
298,core java ,Advanced,What happens if exception is thrown inside static block,Class will fail to load and program may crash
299,core java ,Advanced,How do you design custom exception and when do you use it,We create custom exception when we want to represent business specific error and handle it properly
300,core java ,Advanced,What is difference between shallow copy and deep copy in real bugs,Shallow copy causes shared data issue while deep copy creates independent objects
301,core java ,Advanced,What happens if two objects refer to each other and no one else refers them,Garbage collector can still remove them because it checks reachability not reference count
302,core java ,Advanced,Why finalize method is considered dangerous and not reliable,Because there is no guarantee when it will run and it can delay garbage collection
303,core java ,Advanced,What is memory visibility problem in multithreading,One thread changes value but other thread cannot see it because of CPU cache
304,core java ,Advanced,How volatile solves memory visibility problem,Volatile forces read and write from main memory so all threads see updated value
305,core java ,Advanced,What is difference between Callable and Runnable,Callable can return result and throw exception while Runnable cannot
306,core java ,Advanced,Your program hangs sometimes but no error is shown so how will you debug it,I will take thread dump and check blocked threads and deadlock situation
307,core java ,Advanced,What is difference between composition and inheritance in design decisions,Composition is more flexible and avoids tight coupling while inheritance is rigid
308,core java ,Advanced,Why we say favor composition over inheritance,Because composition allows changing behavior at runtime and reduces dependency
309,core java ,Advanced,What happens if hashCode always returns same value,All entries go into same bucket and HashMap becomes very slow like linked list
310,core java ,Advanced,What is happens if equals is slow and used in HashMap operations,HashMap operations become slow because equals is called frequently during lookup
311,core java ,Advanced,If you had to explain JVM to a junior what will you focus on,I will explain memory areas class loading garbage collection and how code actually runs
312,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code class Test{ static{ int a=10/0; } } when you run it,Class will fail to load and program will throw ExceptionInInitializerError
313,core java ,Advanced,Explain this code public static void main(String[] args){ try{ return; } finally{ System.out.println(end); } },It will print end because finally always executes even if return is called
314,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code class A{ A(){ foo(); } void foo(){ System.out.println(test); } int test=10; },It will print 0 because instance variables are not initialized yet when constructor runs
315,core java ,Advanced,Explain this code Map map=new HashMap map.put(new String(abc) 1) map.put(new String(abc) 2) System.out.println(map.size()),It will print 1 because equals and hashCode treat both keys as same
316,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code if two threads modify same HashMap at same time,It can cause data corruption or infinite loop because HashMap is not thread safe
317,core java ,Advanced,Explain this code volatile boolean flag=true while(flag){ } in multithreading context,Thread will not cache value and will always read latest value from memory
318,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code ExecutorService service=Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor service.submit(task) service.shutdownNow,Task may stop immediately because shutdownNow interrupts running thread
319,core java ,Advanced,Explain this code synchronized(this){ synchronized(this){ } },It will not deadlock because same thread can acquire same lock multiple times
320,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code Object o=new Object synchronized(o){ o.wait(); },Thread will go into waiting state and release the lock
321,core java ,Advanced,Explain this code Object o=new Object o.wait(),It will throw IllegalMonitorStateException because wait must be called inside synchronized block
322,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code Thread t=new Thread t.start t.start,It will throw IllegalThreadStateException because thread cannot be started twice
323,core java ,Advanced,Explain this code class Test{ public void finalize(){ System.out.println(clean); } },There is no guarantee when or if finalize will be called by JVM
324,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code List list=Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList()) list.add(1),It will throw UnsupportedOperationException because list is read only
325,core java ,Advanced,Explain this code class A{ static int x=10; static{ x=20; } },Final value of x will be 20 because static block runs after variable initialization
326,core java ,Advanced,What will happen in this code String s=new String(hi) s.intern(),It will put string in string pool but s will still point to heap object

506,postgresql,Easy,What is the difference between delete and drop,delete removes rows from a table drop removes the entire table structure from the database
507,postgresql,Easy,How do you handle case insensitive text searching,I can use the ilike operator instead of like or use the lower function on the column
508,postgresql,Easy,What is the difference between rollback and abort,in postgres they are synonyms both will cancel the current transaction and discard all changes
509,postgresql,Easy,How do you check the version of the postgres server,Using the query select version
510,postgresql,Easy,What is the default port for Postgres,The default port is 5432
511,postgresql,Easy,How do you log into the postgres command line interface,We use the command line tool called psql

520,postgresql,Intermediate,What is a foreign key,its a column that creates a link between data in two tables it ensures referential integrity by pointing to a primary key in another table
521,postgresql,Intermediate,Does Postgres support json data,Yes it has excellent support for json and jsonb jsonb is the binary version which is faster to process and supports indexing
522,postgresql,Intermediate,What is a view,A view is essentially a stored query it acts like a virtual table that you can query but it doesnt store the data itself
523,postgresql,Intermediate,What is an index and why should we use it,An index is a structure that speeds up data retrieval without it postgres has to do a sequential scan which is very slow for large tables
524,postgresql,Intermediate,Then what is a composite index,Its an index created on multiple columns at once its very useful if your where clause frequently filters by those specific columns together
525,postgresql,Intermediate,How do you start and finish a transaction in postgres,You start with begin and end with commit if something goes wrong you use rollback

542,postgresql,Advanced,What is toast,Toast is how postgres handles large values it compresses them or moves them to a separate side table so the main table stays lean
543,postgresql,Advanced,What is a brin index and when should i use it,Brin stands for block range index it is designed for very large tables where the data is naturally sorted it is much smaller than a b tree index
544,postgresql,Advanced,What is a cte,cte stands for common table expression it is a temporary result set defined using the with clause it makes complex queries much more readable than using subqueries
545,postgresql,Advanced,Can a cte be recursive,Yes recursive ctes are great for querying hierarchical data like an organizational chart or a family tree
546,postgresql,Advanced,What if two people have the same salary how do you handle ties in ranking,In that case i would use window functions like rank function or dense rank function they allow you to rank rows within a partition of a result set

It also has a huge ecosystem of libraries for web development, data science, automation, AI, and more."
550,core python,Intermediate,What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?,"The main difference between a list and a tuple is mutability. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation, while tuples are immutable and cannot be modified once created. Lists are generally used when data needs to be changed frequently, whereas tuples are preferred for fixed data and offer slightly better performance and safety."
551,core python,Easy,How do you comment code in Python?,"In Python, single-line comments are written using the # symbol. Anything after # on that line is ignored by the interpreter. For multi-line documentation, Python uses triple quotes which are commonly used for docstrings to describe functions, classes, or modules."
552,core python,Advanced,Explain Python’s memory management system.,"Python manages memory automatically using a private heap space where all objects are stored. The Python memory manager handles allocation and deallocation. Reference counting is used as the primary technique, where an object is removed when its reference count drops to zero. Additionally, Python has a cyclic garbage collector to clean up reference cycles that reference counting alone cannot handle."
553,core python,Intermediate,What is a Python dictionary and how does it work internally?,"A dictionary is a mutable data structure that stores key-value pairs. Internally, dictionaries use a hash table which allows fast lookup, insertion, and deletion. Each key is hashed to determine where the value is stored. This is why dictionary keys must be immutable and hashable, like strings or tuples."
554,core python,Easy,What are variables in Python?,"Variables in Python are names that refer to objects stored in memory. Python does not require explicit type declarations; the type is inferred at runtime. Variables can reference different data types at different times, making Python dynamically typed."

569,core python,Intermediate,What is list comprehension?,List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists using expressions and optional conditions.
570,core python,Advanced,Difference between shallow copy and deep copy?,"Shallow copy duplicates references, while deep copy creates independent objects recursively."
571,core python,Easy,What does len() do?,len() returns the number of items in a sequence or collection.
572,core python,Intermediate,What are modules and packages?,"Modules are single Python files, while packages are collections of modules organized in directories."
573,core python,Advanced,How does Python handle multithreading?,"Python supports threading, but due to the GIL, it is best suited for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks."
574,core python,Easy,What is print() used for?,print() outputs data to the console for display or debugging.
575,core python,Intermediate,What is *args and **kwargs?,"*args allows variable positional arguments, while **kwargs allows variable keyword arguments."

861,sprin framework,Easy,Before Spring how people usually managed objects and why Spring became popular,Earlier developers created objects manually using new keyword and Spring made it easier by managing object creation and wiring
862,sprin framework,Easy,People say Spring is lightweight so what does that mean,It means Spring does not force heavy configuration and we can use only what we need
863,sprin framework,Easy,Can you explain what is IoC in simple words,IoC means control of object creation is given to Spring instead of developer
864,sprin framework,Easy,So what is dependency injection in your own words,Dependency injection means Spring gives required objects to a class instead of class creating them itself
865,sprin framework,Easy,Why dependency injection is better than using new keyword everywhere,It makes code loosely coupled and easy to test and easy to change
866,sprin framework,Easy,What is Spring container and what does it do,Spring container creates objects manages them and injects dependencies
867,sprin framework,Easy,Have you heard about Bean so what exactly is a Bean in Spring,Bean is simply an object that is created and managed by Spring container
868,sprin framework,Easy,What is ApplicationContext in Spring,ApplicationContext is an advanced container that manages beans and provides many extra features
869,sprin framework,Easy,What is difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext,ApplicationContext is more powerful and used in real applications while BeanFactory is basic
870,sprin framework,Easy,How does Spring know which class it should create object for,Spring uses configuration either XML or annotations to know which classes are beans
871,sprin framework,Easy,You used annotations in Spring so why annotations are helpful,Annotations reduce configuration and make code cleaner and easier to understand
872,sprin framework,Easy,What is @Component annotation used for,It tells Spring that this class should be managed as a bean

891,sprin framework,Intermediate,What is singleton bean problem in multithreading and how Spring handles it,Singleton bean is shared by all threads so we must write thread safe code and Spring does not make it thread safe automatically
892,sprin framework,Intermediate,When do you choose prototype scope instead of singleton,When we need a new object every time and object holds request specific data
893,sprin framework,Intermediate,What is lazy initialization and why it is useful,Lazy initialization means bean is created only when needed and it reduces startup time

911,sprin framework,Advanced,What actually happens when Spring creates a proxy object,Spring creates a wrapper object around real object and calls go through proxy before reaching actual method
912,sprin framework,Advanced,Why Spring uses proxy for AOP and transactions,Spring uses proxy so it can add extra behavior like transaction or logging without changing business code
913,sprin framework,Advanced,In which situation AOP will not work in Spring,It will not work when method is called from same class because call does not go through proxy
914,sprin framework,Advanced,What is difference between JDK proxy and CGLIB proxy,JDK proxy works with interfaces and CGLIB works with classes by creating subclass
915,sprin framework,Advanced,Your @Transactional is not working so what all things you will check,First I will check if method is public and if call is coming from another class and if proxy is created

923,sprin framework,Advanced,Why field injection is not recommended in large projects,Because it makes testing difficult and hides dependencies
924,sprin framework,Advanced,What is difference between eager and lazy initialization in big applications,Eager loads everything at startup and lazy loads when needed so startup time is reduced
925,sprin framework,Advanced,What happens internally when you use @ComponentScan,Spring scans classpath finds annotated classes and registers them in context
926,sprin framework,Advanced,How do you control which beans should be loaded in which environment,We use profiles to load different beans for different environments
927,sprin framework,Advanced,Your production bug is not reproducible locally so how Spring profiles help,Profiles allow using same code with different configuration so we can simulate production environment
928,sprin framework,Advanced,What is FactoryBean and when do you need it,FactoryBean is used when bean creation logic is complex and needs custom code
929,sprin framework,Advanced,What is difference between BeanFactoryPostProcessor and BeanPostProcessor,One modifies bean definitions before creation and other modifies bean after creation

931,sprin framework,Advanced,What is self invocation problem in Spring AOP,When a method inside class calls another method of same class proxy is bypassed so AOP does not work
932,sprin framework,Advanced,Why Spring transactions do not work on private methods,Because proxy can only override public methods
933,sprin framework,Advanced,What happens if two beans depend on each other with constructor injection,Spring cannot resolve it and will throw circular dependency error

979,springboot,Intermediate,Explain this code @RestControllerAdvice class GlobalHandler {},This class will handle exceptions globally for controllers
980,springboot,Intermediate,What will this code do logging.level.root=DEBUG,It will set log level to debug for whole application
981,springboot,Intermediate,Explain this code @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude=SecurityAutoConfiguration.class),It will disable security auto configuration
982,springboot,Intermediate,What will happen in this code spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl auto=update,It will automatically update database schema based on entities
983,springboot,Intermediate,Explain this code @Value(${my.app.name}) private String name,Spring will inject value from properties file into this field
984,springboot,Intermediate,What will happen if database properties are wrong,Application will fail at startup because datasource cannot be created
985,springboot,Advanced,Your Spring Boot application is starting very slowly so how will you analyze it,First I will enable startup logs and actuator and check which beans are taking long time to initialize
986,springboot,Advanced,How do you debug auto configuration issues in Spring Boot,We enable debug mode and check auto configuration report to see what is getting applied
987,springboot,Advanced,Your application works locally but fails in server so how will you approach this,First I will check profiles environment variables and configuration differences
988,springboot,Advanced,What happens internally when Spring Boot application starts,It creates application context loads auto configuration scans components creates beans and then starts embedded server
989,springboot,Advanced,How do you reduce memory usage of Spring Boot application,We reduce object creation disable unused auto configs and tune JVM options
990,springboot,Advanced,What is difference between embedded server and external server in real deployment,Embedded server runs inside app while external server needs separate deployment and management
991,springboot,Advanced,How do you design Spring Boot application for high traffic,We use proper caching connection pooling async processing and scale horizontally
992,springboot,Advanced,How do you monitor Spring Boot application in production,We use actuator metrics logs and external monitoring tools
993,springboot,Advanced,Your service sometimes gives slow response but CPU is fine so what will you check,I will check database calls external API calls and thread blocking issues
994,springboot,Advanced,What is graceful shutdown and why it is important,Graceful shutdown allows running requests to complete before application stops
995,springboot,Advanced,How do you handle configuration in container based deployment,We use environment variables and external config instead of hardcoding
996,springboot,Advanced,What is difference between reactive and normal Spring Boot,Reactive is non blocking and uses event driven model while normal is thread per request
997,springboot,Advanced,When should you choose reactive approach,When handling large number of concurrent requests with IO heavy operations
998,springboot,Advanced,How do you handle versioning of REST APIs in Spring Boot,We use URL versioning or header based versioning to manage changes
999,springboot,Advanced,What is blue green deployment and how Spring Boot fits into it,It is deployment strategy where we switch traffic between two versions and Spring Boot works well due to fast startup
1000,springboot,Advanced,Explain this code spring.main.lazy initialization=true,This will delay bean creation until they are actually needed
1001,springboot,Advanced,What will happen in this code management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health info metrics,It will expose these actuator endpoints
1002,springboot,Advanced,Explain this code @ConditionalOnMissingBean class A {},Spring will create this bean only if no other bean of this type exists
1003,springboot,Advanced,What will happen in this code @SpringBootApplication(excludeName=org.example.SomeAutoConfig),That auto configuration will be skipped during startup
1004,springboot,Advanced,Explain this code server.shutdown=graceful,Application will wait for ongoing requests to finish before stopping
1005,springboot,Advanced,What will happen in this code spring.datasource.hikari.maximum pool size=50,It will set maximum database connection pool size to 50
1006,springboot,Advanced,Explain this code @EnableCaching,It will enable caching support in application
1007,springboot,Advanced,What will happen in this code @Async on a method,Method will run in separate thread and return immediately
1008,springboot,Advanced,Explain this code @Scheduled(fixedRate=5000),This method will run every five seconds
1009,springboot,Advanced,What will happen if actuator endpoints are exposed without security,It can leak sensitive information and is security risk
