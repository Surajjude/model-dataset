SBE001,Easy,So tell me what exactly is Spring Boot and why people prefer it,Spring Boot is built on top of Spring and it makes application development faster by reducing configuration and setup work
SBE002,Easy,Before Spring Boot what problem developers were facing,They had to write lot of configuration and setup manually which was time consuming
SBE003,Easy,What does auto configuration mean in Spring Boot,Auto configuration means Spring Boot automatically configures things based on libraries present in project
SBE004,Easy,What is starter dependency in Spring Boot,Starter is a group of dependencies that we add to get everything needed for a feature
SBE005,Easy,Why people say Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code,Because it provides default configuration and embedded server and simple setup
SBE006,Easy,What is embedded server in Spring Boot,Embedded server means Tomcat or similar server comes inside application and we do not need to deploy separately
SBE007,Easy,How do you usually run Spring Boot application,We run it using main method or using mvn spring boot run
SBE008,Easy,What is application properties file used for,It is used to write configuration like port number and database details
SBE009,Easy,What is difference between Spring and Spring Boot,Spring Boot removes manual configuration and makes Spring easier to use
SBE010,Easy,What is @SpringBootApplication annotation,It is a combination of configuration component scan and auto configuration
SBE011,Easy,Why Spring Boot is good for microservices,Because it is lightweight easy to start and has embedded server
SBE012,Easy,What is actuator in Spring Boot,Actuator provides endpoints to monitor and manage application
SBE013,Easy,What is default port of Spring Boot application,Default port is 8080
SBE014,Easy,How do you change port in Spring Boot,We change it in application properties file
SBE015,Easy,What is fat jar in Spring Boot,Fat jar is a jar file that contains application code and all dependencies and server

SBE016,Easy,Explain this code @SpringBootApplication public class App { public static void main(String[] args){ SpringApplication.run(App.class args); } },This code starts Spring Boot application and creates Spring container
SBE017,Easy,What will happen if you run this main method,Application will start and embedded server will also start
SBE018,Easy,Explain this code @RestController public class Test { @GetMapping(hello) public String test(){ return hi; } },This will create a REST endpoint and when we open hello in browser it will return hi
SBE019,Easy,What will happen in this code server.port=9090 in application properties,Application will start on port 9090 instead of 8080
SBE020,Easy,Explain this code @SpringBootApplication @ComponentScan(basePackages=com.app),Spring Boot will scan only this package for components
SBE021,Easy,What will this code do @SpringBootApplication(exclude=DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class),It will disable database auto configuration
SBE022,Easy,Explain this code SpringApplication.run(App.class args),It will bootstrap the application and start Spring context
SBE023,Easy,What will happen if application properties file is missing,Application will still start using default values
SBE024,Easy,Explain this code @Value(${server.port}) private int port,Spring will inject port value from properties file into this variable
SBE025,Easy,What will happen if two controllers have same URL mapping,Application will fail at startup because of ambiguous mapping


SBM001,Medium,In real projects how do you manage different environments like dev and prod in Spring Boot,We use profiles and different properties files so each environment can have its own configuration
SBM002,Medium,What is Spring Boot profile and why it is important,Profile helps us load different beans and configuration based on environment
SBM003,Medium,How do you activate a specific profile in application,We can activate profile using properties file or command line argument
SBM004,Medium,What happens if no profile is active in Spring Boot,Default configuration is used
SBM005,Medium,How do you configure database in Spring Boot,We write database details in application properties and Spring Boot auto configures datasource
SBM006,Medium,What is connection pooling and why it matters,Connection pooling reuses database connections and improves performance
SBM007,Medium,How does Spring Boot decide which beans to auto configure,It checks classpath and configuration and then applies conditions
SBM008,Medium,What is condition annotation used for,It is used to load bean only when certain condition is true
SBM009,Medium,What is difference between application properties and application yml,Both are used for configuration but yml is more structured and readable
SBM010,Medium,How do you handle exceptions globally in Spring Boot,We use controller advice to catch and handle exceptions in one place
SBM011,Medium,What is actuator and how do you use it in real projects,Actuator is used to monitor application health metrics and other info
SBM012,Medium,How do you enable logging and change log level in Spring Boot,We configure it in application properties file
SBM013,Medium,What is devtools and why it is useful,Devtools helps in auto restart and faster development
SBM014,Medium,How do you secure sensitive values like passwords in properties,We use environment variables or external config and do not hardcode them
SBM015,Medium,What is difference between @RestController and @Controller in Spring Boot,@RestController directly returns response body while @Controller returns view name

SBM016,Medium,Explain this code @Profile(dev) @Component class A {},This bean will only be loaded when dev profile is active
SBM017,Medium,What will happen in this code spring.profiles.active=prod in properties,Spring Boot will load prod configuration
SBM018,Medium,Explain this code @ConfigurationProperties(prefix=db),Spring will bind properties starting with db to this class fields
SBM019,Medium,What will happen in this code @ConditionalOnProperty(name=feature.enabled havingValue=true),Bean will be loaded only if property is true
SBM020,Medium,Explain this code @RestControllerAdvice class GlobalHandler {},This class will handle exceptions globally for controllers
SBM021,Medium,What will this code do logging.level.root=DEBUG,It will set log level to debug for whole application
SBM022,Medium,Explain this code @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude=SecurityAutoConfiguration.class),It will disable security auto configuration
SBM023,Medium,What will happen in this code spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl auto=update,It will automatically update database schema based on entities
SBM024,Medium,Explain this code @Value(${my.app.name}) private String name,Spring will inject value from properties file into this field
SBM025,Medium,What will happen if database properties are wrong,Application will fail at startup because datasource cannot be created

SBH001,Hard,Your Spring Boot application is starting very slowly so how will you analyze it,First I will enable startup logs and actuator and check which beans are taking long time to initialize
SBH002,Hard,How do you debug auto configuration issues in Spring Boot,We enable debug mode and check auto configuration report to see what is getting applied
SBH003,Hard,Your application works locally but fails in server so how will you approach this,First I will check profiles environment variables and configuration differences
SBH004,Hard,What happens internally when Spring Boot application starts,It creates application context loads auto configuration scans components creates beans and then starts embedded server
SBH005,Hard,How do you reduce memory usage of Spring Boot application,We reduce object creation disable unused auto configs and tune JVM options
SBH006,Hard,What is difference between embedded server and external server in real deployment,Embedded server runs inside app while external server needs separate deployment and management
SBH007,Hard,How do you design Spring Boot application for high traffic,We use proper caching connection pooling async processing and scale horizontally
SBH008,Hard,How do you monitor Spring Boot application in production,We use actuator metrics logs and external monitoring tools
SBH009,Hard,Your service sometimes gives slow response but CPU is fine so what will you check,I will check database calls external API calls and thread blocking issues
SBH010,Hard,What is graceful shutdown and why it is important,Graceful shutdown allows running requests to complete before application stops
SBH011,Hard,How do you handle configuration in container based deployment,We use environment variables and external config instead of hardcoding
SBH012,Hard,What is difference between reactive and normal Spring Boot,Reactive is non blocking and uses event driven model while normal is thread per request
SBH013,Hard,When should you choose reactive approach,When handling large number of concurrent requests with IO heavy operations
SBH014,Hard,How do you handle versioning of REST APIs in Spring Boot,We use URL versioning or header based versioning to manage changes
SBH015,Hard,What is blue green deployment and how Spring Boot fits into it,It is deployment strategy where we switch traffic between two versions and Spring Boot works well due to fast startup

SBH016,Hard,Explain this code spring.main.lazy initialization=true,This will delay bean creation until they are actually needed
SBH017,Hard,What will happen in this code management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health info metrics,It will expose these actuator endpoints
SBH018,Hard,Explain this code @ConditionalOnMissingBean class A {},Spring will create this bean only if no other bean of this type exists
SBH019,Hard,What will happen in this code @SpringBootApplication(excludeName=org.example.SomeAutoConfig),That auto configuration will be skipped during startup
SBH020,Hard,Explain this code server.shutdown=graceful,Application will wait for ongoing requests to finish before stopping
SBH021,Hard,What will happen in this code spring.datasource.hikari.maximum pool size=50,It will set maximum database connection pool size to 50
SBH022,Hard,Explain this code @EnableCaching,It will enable caching support in application
SBH023,Hard,What will happen in this code @Async on a method,Method will run in separate thread and return immediately
SBH024,Hard,Explain this code @Scheduled(fixedRate=5000),This method will run every five seconds
SBH025,Hard,What will happen if actuator endpoints are exposed without security,It can leak sensitive information and is security risk
