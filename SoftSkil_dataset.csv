1,"You notice a colleague consistently missing deadlines, impacting the team's progress. How do you address this situation?","First, I would schedule a private, informal conversation with my colleague. I would start by expressing my concern about the missed deadlines and the impact on the team, focusing on the project's progress rather than making personal accusations. I would then genuinely inquire about the reasons behind the missed deadlines, actively listening to understand any challenges they might be facing, such as workload issues, lack of resources, or skill gaps. Next, I would offer my support and brainstorm potential solutions collaboratively. This might involve helping them prioritize tasks, suggesting time management techniques, or offering to share my knowledge or skills. If the issue persists or appears to be more serious (e.g., personal issues, consistent lack of skill), I would then escalate the situation to my manager or team lead, providing them with a clear and concise summary of the situation and the steps I've already taken. It's important to maintain professionalism and focus on resolving the problem to ensure the team's success.",Intermediate
2,"During a team meeting, your idea is dismissed, but you believe it has merit. What do you do?","If my idea is dismissed in a team meeting but I still believe it has merit, I would first respectfully acknowledge the team's feedback and try to understand their concerns. I'd ask clarifying questions to ensure I understand why the idea was dismissed and address those concerns directly, possibly by presenting additional data, research, or a refined version of the idea that incorporates their feedback. I will then determine if it's the right time to push for it. If not, I will note down the team's concerns, do more research to address them, and bring it up again in a future meeting or a one-on-one conversation with relevant stakeholders. If after further discussion, the team still doesn't support the idea, I would respect their decision and focus on supporting the team's chosen direction. It's important to remember that collaboration and team consensus are crucial, and sometimes the best course of action is to align with the group's decision, even if it differs from my initial perspective. I could also ask for a chance to run a small A/B test or prototype to validate the idea, if applicable and feasible.",Advanced
3,You accidentally spill coffee on a coworker's important documents. What is your immediate reaction?,"My immediate reaction would be to apologize profusely and sincerely to my coworker. I would then assess the damage and offer to help in any way possible. This might include offering to help clean up the spill, seeing if the documents can be salvaged, or offering to assist in re-creating them. I'd also offer to pay for the cost of reprinting or replacing the documents, and I would immediately inform my manager about the accident and the steps I am taking to rectify the situation. My priority would be to minimize the impact of my mistake and demonstrate my commitment to resolving the issue as quickly and effectively as possible.",Easy
4,"You are assigned a task you have never done before, and you are unsure where to start. What is your approach?","When faced with a completely new task, my initial approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. I start by clarifying the requirements and desired outcome, ensuring I fully understand what needs to be achieved. Then, I research and gather information related to the task, looking for existing solutions, documentation, tutorials, or relevant examples. This often involves searching online, consulting with colleagues or subject matter experts, and exploring internal resources. Next, I prioritize learning the essential skills or tools needed to complete the task. This might involve taking a quick online course, working through a tutorial, or experimenting with code snippets. I then create a basic plan or outline, focusing on the core functionality first and iterating as I learn more. I adopt a learning-by-doing approach, experimenting with solutions, testing frequently, and seeking feedback along the way. If it's a coding-related task, I'd focus on writing clean, well-documented code with unit tests.",Intermediate
5,You observe a colleague taking credit for your work during a presentation. How do you handle this?,"In the moment, I would likely remain professional and avoid directly confronting my colleague during the presentation. After the presentation, I would calmly and privately speak with the colleague. I'd explain that I was the one who did the work and felt it was important to clarify the contributions for future collaboration. If the issue persists, I would then consider speaking with my manager to address the situation. I would present factual evidence of my work and the impact of the misrepresentation, focusing on the project goals and my contributions.",Advanced
6,Your supervisor gives you conflicting instructions from what you learned in training. Which do you follow?,"In this situation, I would first respectfully clarify the discrepancy with my supervisor. It's possible there's a misunderstanding, a change in procedure I'm unaware of, or a specific reason why the training is being overridden in this instance. I'd explain that my understanding from training is different and ask for clarification on the appropriate course of action and the reasoning behind it. If, after clarification, my supervisor still insists on deviating from the training, I would politely express my concern about the potential implications of not following the established protocols. However, ultimately, I would follow my supervisor's instructions while also documenting the specific instructions received, the rationale provided (if any), and the potential risks or deviations from standard practice. This documentation protects me and provides a record if questions arise later. If the deviation poses a safety risk or violates ethical guidelines, I would escalate the concern to the appropriate channels, such as HR or a more senior manager.",Advanced
7,A customer is upset and yelling at you about a product malfunction. How do you respond?,"I would remain calm and empathetic, allowing the customer to express their frustration without interruption (unless it becomes abusive). I would actively listen to understand the specific issue and acknowledge their feelings, apologizing for the inconvenience caused by the product malfunction. Then, I'd reassure them that I'm committed to finding a solution. Next, I'd ask clarifying questions to gather more information about the problem. After gathering sufficient information, I would try to solve the issue, and explain all the possible solutions to the customer in simple language. If I can't solve it immediately, I'll clearly explain the next steps, provide a timeline, and offer alternative solutions or compensation where applicable to ensure the customer feels valued and heard.",Intermediate

What are your next steps?,"My immediate next step would be to acknowledge the mistake and assess the full impact on the project deadline. This involves understanding the scope of the error, the resources required to fix it, and how the fix will affect other parts of the project. Next, I would communicate the issue to the relevant stakeholders (project manager, team members). Transparency is key. I would explain the mistake, the potential impact on the deadline, and propose a plan to rectify the situation. This might involve working extra hours, re-prioritizing tasks, or seeking assistance from other team members. I would also offer alternative solutions or workarounds to mitigate the delay as much as possible and keep the project on track.",Intermediate
9,You overhear two colleagues arguing loudly in the breakroom. What is your response?,"My immediate response would be to assess the situation quickly. Is it a heated disagreement that could potentially escalate to something physical or involve HR-related issues (harassment, discrimination)? If so, my priority is to ensure safety and potentially involve HR or a manager. If it seems like a regular disagreement, I would likely give them a few minutes to resolve it themselves. If the argument persists or seems unproductive, I would politely intervene. Something like, ""Hey folks, is everything alright? Is there anything I can do to help?"" I'd aim to de-escalate the situation by offering a neutral perspective or suggesting they take a break and discuss it later. My goal would be to help them find a more constructive way to communicate and resolve their disagreement.",Advanced
10,You are asked to complete a task that you believe is outside your job description. How do you proceed?,"First, I would clarify my understanding of the task with my manager to confirm its scope and how it aligns with the team's goals. I would then assess my current workload and skillset to determine if I can realistically take on the task without compromising existing responsibilities or producing substandard work. If I believe I can complete the task, I will do so, viewing it as an opportunity to learn and grow. If, however, I determine that the task is significantly outside my expertise or would negatively impact my current workload, I would respectfully explain my concerns to my manager, suggesting alternative solutions or individuals better suited for the task. I would frame this as a desire to ensure the best possible outcome for the project and the team.",Intermediate
11,Your team is facing a major setback on a project. How do you help maintain morale?,"First, acknowledge the setback and validate everyone's feelings. It's crucial to create a safe space for the team to express their frustrations and concerns without judgment. Transparency is key; honestly communicate the situation's impact, but also emphasize the team's ability to overcome it. Then, focus on solutions and a path forward. Involve the team in brainstorming new approaches or adjusting the project plan. Celebrate small wins and remind the team of past successes. Show appreciation for their hard work and dedication, and emphasize that setbacks are a normal part of the process and learning opportunities. Keep communication open and frequent, providing regular updates and encouragement to maintain a sense of progress and unity.",Advanced
12,You receive negative feedback from your manager. How do you react?,"My initial reaction would be to listen carefully and try to understand the specific points my manager is making. I would ask clarifying questions to ensure I fully grasp the feedback and the reasons behind it. It's important to remain calm and avoid becoming defensive. After the meeting, I would take time to reflect on the feedback. I would consider how I can improve in the areas mentioned and develop a plan of action to address the concerns. I would also schedule a follow-up meeting with my manager to discuss my plan and ensure that we're aligned on expectations moving forward. Demonstrating a willingness to learn and grow from feedback is crucial for professional development.",Intermediate
13,"You notice a security breach in the office, such as an unlocked door late at night. What do you do?","First, I would immediately secure the area if it's safe to do so. For example, if it's an unlocked door, I would lock it.

I'd apologize for the inconvenience and offer to catch them up on anything missed upon my arrival. While en route, I'd mentally prepare myself for the meeting, reviewing the agenda (if available) and key discussion points to minimize disruption and ensure I can contribute effectively despite my tardiness. Upon arrival, I'd quietly enter the meeting, apologize again briefly to the attendees, and quickly get up to speed.",Easy
16,"A colleague asks you for help with a task, but you are already overwhelmed with your own workload. How do you respond?","Thanks for reaching out! I'd like to help, but I'm currently juggling several urgent deadlines and my plate is pretty full. To ensure I can give your task the attention it deserves and meet my own commitments, I need to prioritize carefully. Could you tell me more about the task's urgency and deadline? Understanding the context will help me figure out the best way to assist. Perhaps I can suggest alternative resources, point you to relevant documentation, or we could explore re-prioritizing some of my existing tasks. If it is something simple, I may also be able to provide some quick guidance.",Intermediate
17,You realize that a coworker is spreading rumors about another colleague. What do you do?,"First, I would assess the situation. Is the rumor truly harmful or malicious? Is it impacting the colleague's work or reputation? If I believe the rumor is causing significant harm, I would speak directly and privately with the coworker who is spreading it. I would explain that their actions are inappropriate and unprofessional, and that they are creating a negative work environment. I would encourage them to stop spreading the rumors. If the behavior continues, or if the rumor is particularly serious (e.g., discriminatory or harassing), I would report the situation to my manager or HR. It's important to protect the colleague being targeted and maintain a respectful and professional workplace.",Intermediate
18,Your team is asked to implement a new policy that you disagree with. How do you handle this?,"First, I would ensure I fully understand the policy and the reasoning behind it. I would actively listen to the team and leadership to grasp the context and objectives. If, after understanding, I still have concerns, I would respectfully voice them, providing specific reasons and potential alternative solutions, backed by data or examples where possible. My goal would be to engage in a constructive dialogue to explore the issue from different angles. Even if my concerns are not fully addressed and the policy is implemented, I would commit to supporting the team and implementing the policy to the best of my ability. I believe in the importance of team cohesion and supporting decisions even when I personally disagree. I would continue to monitor the policy's impact and provide further feedback if necessary, always aiming for the best outcome for the team and the organization.",Advanced
19,"You are presenting to a client, and you realize you have made a mistake in your presentation. How do you recover?","First, acknowledge the mistake quickly and directly. Don't try to gloss over it or hope no one notices. A simple, ""I apologize, there's an error on this slide. The correct figure/information is [state the correct information]"" is usually sufficient. Then, briefly explain the cause of the error, if appropriate and if it adds clarity or context. Avoid making excuses or blaming others. Focus on providing the correct information and moving forward. If the mistake has significant implications for the client's understanding or decision-making, offer to provide revised materials or further clarification after the presentation.",Intermediate
20,You are asked to work overtime on short notice. How do you respond if you have prior commitments?,"Thank you for offering me the opportunity to work overtime. I appreciate being considered. Unfortunately, I have prior commitments scheduled for that time and won't be able to stay late. I've already made arrangements that I can't easily reschedule. I'm happy to discuss alternative solutions, if possible. For instance, could the task be delegated, or could I come in early tomorrow to complete it? If the task is urgent, I can also outline the steps for someone else to take over, ensuring a smooth handover.",Easy
21,"During lunch you see a senior colleague bully a junior colleague, how do you respond?","My immediate response would depend on the severity and nature of the bullying. If it's a subtle instance of belittling or exclusion, I would try to subtly intervene by changing the subject or offering support to the junior colleague with a kind word or a smile. I would also observe the interaction closely. If the bullying is more overt or aggressive, I would directly but respectfully address the senior colleague in private later. I would calmly explain that their behavior was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable, emphasizing the impact on the junior colleague and the team's overall morale. If the behavior persists, I would escalate the issue to HR or another appropriate authority, documenting the incidents as thoroughly as possible.",Advanced
22,There is a new work process that has been introduced and you see that the rest of your team is not following it. What do you do?,"First, I would try to understand why my team isn't following the new process. Is it unclear, too cumbersome, or are there legitimate concerns about its effectiveness? I'd casually discuss it with a few colleagues to gather insights and identify potential roadblocks. Then, I would address my concerns constructively. This might involve offering suggestions for improvement to the team lead or manager, or volunteering to help clarify the process for others. If the process is flawed, I'd focus on providing data-driven feedback. If it's a matter of understanding, I'd offer assistance to my teammates directly, emphasizing the benefits of adhering to the new process and addressing any confusion.",Intermediate
23,You find a wallet on the floor and it has a credit card and drivers license. What do you do?,"My immediate action would be to look for any contact information inside the wallet, such as a phone number or an address. If I find a phone number, I would call the owner to arrange a return. If there's an address, I might consider dropping it off if it's nearby. If neither of those options are feasible, I would mail the wallet (or at least the driver's license and credit card) to the address on the driver's license. Alternatively, I could turn the wallet in to the local police station. They would be able to identify the owner through the driver's license and contact them. I would avoid using the credit card in any way, as that could be considered fraud.",Easy
24,Your manager has been giving you a lot of work but you are unable to complete it due to personal reasons. How do you approach this situation?,"I would first acknowledge and accept responsibility for my inability to meet the current workload demands due to personal reasons. Transparency is key, so I would schedule a private meeting with my manager as soon as possible. During the meeting, I would explain the situation clearly and concisely, without going into excessive detail about the personal reasons unless necessary and comfortable. I would emphasize my commitment to my work and express my regret for not being able to deliver as expected. I would then propose a plan of action: Prioritize tasks: Ask for guidance in identifying the most critical tasks and focusing on those first. Suggest alternative solutions: Explore delegating some tasks to other team members or postponing less urgent deadlines. Offer a timeline: Provide a realistic estimate of when I anticipate being able to resume my normal workload. Seek Support: Request support from manager if any assistance needed.",Intermediate
25,"You are in a meeting with your skip level manager, and they ask you about your team. They specifically ask you about an area that the team needs to improve upon. What do you say?","Thanks for asking about the team. One area we're actively working on improving is cross-functional collaboration, specifically with the UX team on the design specifications for upcoming features. We're addressing this by implementing several strategies: 1) Encouraging early and frequent communication during the design phase. 2) Establishing shared documentation and review processes. 3) Setting up recurring sync meetings for the UX team and the engineering team. We're tracking the results of these initiatives and are confident we'll see improvements in the next quarter.",Advanced
26,You have been working for 6 months and realize that you dont like the work. What do you do?,"The first thing I would do is reflect on why I don't like the work. Is it the specific tasks, the company culture, my team, or the overall industry? Once I've identified the root cause, I'd explore potential solutions within the current role, such as discussing my concerns with my manager and seeking opportunities to take on different responsibilities or projects that align better with my interests and skills. If internal solutions don't seem feasible or effective after a reasonable effort, I'd start exploring external options. This might involve networking, updating my resume and LinkedIn profile, and applying for jobs that are a better fit. It's crucial to maintain professionalism and a positive attitude throughout this process, both for my current role and for potential future opportunities. I would also seek advice from mentors or career counselors to guide me in my job search.",Intermediate
27,Your team despises using a specific software application but the manager wants you to keep using it. What do you do?,"First, I would try to understand why the team despises the software. Gather specific feedback on pain points, inefficiencies, and alternative solutions they might suggest. Then, I would research alternative solutions and quantify the impact of switching. This includes cost analysis, time savings, improved efficiency, and reduced errors. I would then present a well-documented case to the manager, outlining the team's concerns, supporting data, and a proposal for transitioning to a better solution. If the manager still insists on using the application, I would continue to gather data and communicate concerns while also seeking opportunities to improve the usability of the current application (e.g., scripts, training, automation).",Advanced
28,You have determined a software is ineffective. How do you communicate this effectively?,"When communicating that software is ineffective, focus on objective evidence and potential solutions. Start by clearly outlining the specific problems observed, backing them up with data and metrics. For instance, if performance is an issue, quantify the slowdown or error rates. If usability is the problem, cite user feedback or usability test results. Be specific about how these issues impact business goals, user experience, or project timelines. Next, propose alternative solutions or improvements. This could involve suggesting a different software, recommending modifications to the existing one, or outlining a plan for addressing the root causes of the ineffectiveness. Frame the communication as a collaborative effort to find the best path forward.

Is it based on performance considerations, maintainability, scalability, security, or something else? Once we understand the underlying priorities, we can evaluate the options against those priorities. If the team is still deadlocked, I would suggest prototyping the different approaches or seeking input from a senior engineer or architect to help resolve the conflict and guide us towards the most suitable design.",Advanced
30,You notice a coworker is consistently late. How do you handle it?,"First, I'd consider if there's a reason for the lateness that I'm unaware of. Company policy may dictate different approaches for addressing tardiness. If it's impacting team productivity or deadlines, I would politely and privately speak to my coworker. I would express my concern and ask if there's anything I can do to support them in arriving on time. If the lateness continues, I would inform my manager or HR, as it becomes a performance issue beyond my ability to resolve. It is important to document instances of lateness before escalating to management. It is the manager's responsibility to address the repeated tardiness, as it could affect team morale and productivity.",Intermediate
31,A customer is upset and yelling. What do you do?,"The most important thing is to remain calm and professional. I would actively listen to the customer, letting them fully express their frustration without interruption (unless the situation becomes abusive). I would use empathetic language like ""I understand why you're upset"" to show that I acknowledge their feelings. Once they've finished speaking, I would apologize for the situation and then ask clarifying questions to fully understand the issue. I would then explain the steps I can take to resolve their problem and keep them informed of the progress. If I can't resolve the issue myself, I would escalate it to someone who can, ensuring the customer is aware of the escalation process and expected timeline.",Intermediate
32,You made a mistake on an important task. What are your next steps?,"My immediate next step would be to acknowledge the mistake and take responsibility for it. I would then carefully analyze what went wrong to understand the root cause. This involves retracing my steps, reviewing any relevant data or processes, and identifying the specific point where the error occurred. Following the analysis, I would focus on rectifying the mistake as quickly and efficiently as possible. Depending on the nature of the task and the error, this might involve redoing the task, implementing a workaround, or escalating the issue to a supervisor or team member for assistance. Crucially, I would communicate proactively with all stakeholders affected by the mistake, keeping them informed of the situation and the steps being taken to resolve it. Finally, I'd document the error and the resolution to help prevent similar mistakes in the future, and share the learning with relevant colleagues.",Intermediate

I would also be transparent about my progress and any roadblocks I encounter, seeking guidance and support from the team as needed.",Intermediate
34,You disagree with your supervisor's decision. How do you voice your opinion?,"If I disagree with my supervisor's decision, I would first ensure I understand the reasoning behind it by respectfully asking clarifying questions. This demonstrates that I'm genuinely trying to understand their perspective and not just being argumentative. Then, I would calmly and professionally express my concerns, focusing on the potential impact of the decision and offering alternative solutions, if possible. I would frame my disagreement as a way to improve the outcome and highlight any relevant data or evidence to support my viewpoint. I would also be prepared to accept their final decision, understanding that they have a broader view of the situation.",Advanced

I would state something along the lines of ""Hey, I noticed you presented the XYZ project as your own in the meeting. I actually developed that part and just wanted to clarify that for future reference."" If the behavior continues, or if the initial conversation doesn't resolve the issue, I would then escalate the matter to my manager or HR, providing specific examples and documentation to support my claim. The goal is to professionally protect my contributions and ensure proper recognition while maintaining a positive working relationship, if possible.",Advanced
36,You are given two tasks with the same deadline but require different skill sets. How will you prioritize?,"I'd evaluate the criticality and impact of each task. If one task is crucial for a key project milestone or has a direct impact on a high-priority business objective, I'd prioritize that one, even if it means needing to quickly upskill or seek assistance for the other. If both have similar criticality, I would consider factors like: Dependencies: Does one task block progress on other tasks? Effort estimation: Which one can be completed more quickly? Personal bandwidth: Which one am I better equipped to handle immediately? Ultimately, I would communicate my prioritization and rationale to stakeholders, especially if it means delaying one of the tasks. Transparency and proactive communication are key.",Intermediate
37,A team member is not contributing their fair share. How would you handle this situation?,"First, I'd try to understand why the team member isn't contributing. I'd schedule a private, informal conversation to discuss any potential roadblocks, personal issues, skill gaps, or misunderstandings regarding their role or tasks. I would frame the conversation as seeking their perspective and offering support, rather than making accusations. If the issue persists after the initial conversation, and assuming the reasons are not related to personal circumstances requiring accommodations, I'd clearly communicate expectations and provide specific, measurable goals with deadlines. If there are still no improvements, I would then escalate the issue to my manager, providing documentation of the initial conversations and unmet expectations. This ensures transparency and allows for further action within the company's performance management framework.",Intermediate
38,You accidentally sent a confidential email to the wrong person. What are your immediate actions?,"My immediate actions would be: Immediately notify my manager and the relevant security/compliance team. Time is of the essence, and they need to be informed of the breach. Provide them with all the details: who the email was sent to, what information was contained, and the time it was sent. Contact the recipient. If possible, I'd immediately contact the person who received the email. I would politely explain the situation, inform them that the email contained confidential information sent in error, and request that they delete the email and any attachments without opening or forwarding them. I would also ask them to confirm that they have done so. Maintain a record of this communication.",Easy
39,"During a meeting, someone shares an idea you had been working on independently. What do you do?","First, I would listen carefully to the idea being presented. It's possible the person has added a new perspective or improved upon my original concept. I would then acknowledge that the idea is similar to one I've been exploring. Depending on the context and my relationship with the person, I might briefly mention my prior work on the idea and offer to share my research or progress, emphasizing collaboration and building upon each other's work. My intention would be to contribute positively to the conversation and ensure proper attribution, without creating unnecessary conflict.",Intermediate

Finally, recover the systems and data. Restore from backups, rebuild compromised systems, and implement enhanced security measures to prevent future incidents. After resolving the issue, notify stakeholders according to company policy (legal, public relations, etc.) and document the entire process for future reference and improvement. Consider forensics analysis.",Advanced
42,A coworker is spreading rumors about another employee. How do you react?,"First, I would address the coworker directly and privately. I would explain that spreading rumors is unprofessional, creates a negative work environment, and can be damaging to the person being discussed. I'd ask them to stop and remind them of company policy regarding respectful workplace conduct. If the behavior continues or if the rumors are particularly harmful, I would report the situation to HR or my manager. It's important to document the rumors and the impact they are having so that appropriate action can be taken to protect the employee being targeted and maintain a positive workplace.",Intermediate
43,You are asked to do a task that is outside your job description. How do you respond?,"I would first assess my current workload and commitments. If I have the capacity, I am generally open to taking on tasks outside my defined job description, especially if it presents an opportunity to learn a new skill or contribute to a team goal. I would clarify the expectations, timeline, and required resources for the new task to ensure I can deliver it effectively without compromising my existing responsibilities. If I am already overloaded or lack the necessary skills, I would communicate this to my manager or the person assigning the task. I might suggest alternative solutions, such as delegating the task to someone else who is better suited or offering to assist with a portion of the task within my capabilities. Transparency and clear communication are key to ensuring that tasks are handled appropriately and that I can continue to perform my core duties effectively.",Intermediate
44,You are overwhelmed with your workload and struggling to keep up. How do you manage your time and responsibilities?,"When feeling overwhelmed, I first take a step back to assess the situation and prioritize tasks. I create a list of all outstanding responsibilities and then categorize them based on urgency and importance, often using a method like the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important). I then focus on the most critical items first, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, if a large project is due soon, I might allocate specific time blocks to focus on individual aspects of the project, like research, coding, testing, and documentation. I also communicate proactively with my manager and team members about my workload, seeking assistance or negotiating deadlines where possible. This open communication ensures everyone is aware of the challenges and allows for collaborative problem-solving. Additionally, I make sure to schedule regular breaks to avoid burnout and maintain focus. Time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique can be very helpful. I also look for opportunities to delegate tasks where appropriate and automate repetitive tasks to free up time for more important responsibilities. Finally, I regularly review my progress and adjust my plan as needed to stay on track and maintain a sustainable workload.",Advanced
