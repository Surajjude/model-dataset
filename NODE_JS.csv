21,Medium,What is the difference between app.use() and app.get(),"app.use() applies middleware to all requests (or a specific path prefix), whereas app.get() only matches GET requests for a specific route"
22,Medium,How do you handle 404 errors in Express,Add a middleware function at the very end of the stack that sends a 404 response
23,Medium,"Explain the concept of ""Error Handling Middleware""","It is a function with 4 arguments: (err, req, res, next). Express recognizes this signature as an error handler"
24,Medium,Why shouldn't you block the Event Loop,Because Node.js is single-threaded; blocking it prevents the server from handling any other incoming requests
25,Medium,How do you safely handle secrets (API keys) in Node,Use environment variables (via dotenv package) and never commit .env files to version control
26,Medium,How do you execute multiple asynchronous tasks in paralle,Using Promise.all()
27,Medium,What is the purpose of express.Router(),"It creates modular, mountable route handlers (mini-apps) to organize routes into separate files"
28,Medium,What is the difference between res.send() and res.json(),"res.json() enforces proper JSON headers and formatting, while res.send() automatically detects content type (text/html/json) based on the data"
29,Medium,"What is a ""Stream"" in Node.js",An abstract interface for working with streaming data
30,Medium,How does Node.js handle file uploads,Typically using middleware like multer or express-fileupload to handle multipart/form-data
31,Medium,What is the difference between spawn and exec in the child_process module,"spawn returns a stream (better for large data/long processes), while exec buffers the output and returns it all at once (better for small commands)"
32,Medium,What is a JWT (JSON Web Token),A stateless way to handle authentication where a signed token is sent to the client and sent back with requests to verify identity
33,Medium,What is the default timeout for a Node.js HTTP server,"Typically 2 minutes (120,000 ms), but it is configurable"
34,Medium,"What is the ""Callback Pattern""",Passing a function as an argument to handle the result (error or data) of an asynchronous operation once it completes
35,Medium,Why do we prefer async/await over callbacks,"It avoids ""Callback Hell"" and makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability"
36,Medium,What is the difference between dependencies and peerDependencies,dependencies are required to run the app; peerDependencies expect the host project to have a specific version of a package installed (common in plugins)
37,Medium,How do you connect to a MongoDB database in Node,Typically using the mongoose library or the native mongodb driver
38,Medium,What happens if you try to res.send twice in the same reques,"Express will throw an error: ""Error: Can't set headers after they are sent"
39,Medium,How do you structure a large Express application,"MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller) or separating into routes, controllers, services, and models folders"
40,Medium,What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS),A browser security feature; you handle it in Express using the cors middleware to allow requests from different domains
41,Hard,Explain the Phases of the Node.js Event Loop,Timers -> Pending Callbacks -> Idle/Prepare -> Poll (I/O) -> Check (setImmediate) -> Close Callbacks
42,Hard,"Node.js is single-threaded, but how does it handle file I/O operations concurrently","libuv uses a thread pool (default 4 threads) to handle ""expensive"" tasks like file I/O and crypto off the main thread"
43,Hard,What is the Cluster Module,"A module that allows you to create child processes (workers) that share the same server port, enabling Node to utilize multi-core systems"
44,Hard,"What are ""Worker Threads""","A module (worker_threads) that enables true multi-threading for CPU-intensive JavaScript tasks (unlike Cluster, which splits processes)"
45,Hard,How would you debug a Memory Leak in Node.js,"Using Chrome DevTools ""Memory"" tab (Heap Snapshots), looking for detached objects or huge closures"
46,Hard,What is Backpressure in Streams,When the data buffer fills up faster than the consumer can process it; .pipe() handles this automatically by pausing the readable stream
47,Hard,Difference between Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling in Node,Vertical: Adding more RAM/CPU to the single server. Horizontal: Adding more server instances and using a Load Balancer
48,Hard,"What is a Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx) and why use it with Node","It sits in front of Node, handling SSL termination, static files, compression, and load balancing, protecting the Node process"
49,Hard,What is Buffer in Node.js,"A global class to handle binary data (raw memory allocation) directly, necessary because JS originally only handled strings"
50,Hard,"Explain ""Keep-Alive"" in HTTP and how it affects Node","It keeps the TCP connection open for multiple requests, reducing handshake overhead. Node enables this by default in recent versions"
51,Hard,Difference between fork() and spawn(),fork is a special case of spawn specifically for Node processes; it establishes an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) channel between parent and child.
52,Hard,How does Express handle template engines,"Using app.set('view engine', 'pug') and res.render()"
53,Hard,"What is ""Middleware Chaining""",The mechanism where multiple middleware functions are executed in sequence using next(
54,Hard,How do you gracefully shut down a Node server,"Listen for SIGTERM/SIGINT signals, stop accepting new connections (server.close()), finish pending requests, close DB connections, then exit"
55,Hard,What is the difference between TCP and UDP,"TCP is reliable/ordered (HTTP, WebSockets); UDP is fast/unreliable (Video streaming, DNS). Node supports both via net and dgram modules"
56,Hard,"What is a ""Zombie Process""",A child process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table
57,Hard,How does Node.js Garbage Collection work,"It uses V8's ""Mark-and-Sweep"" algorithm. It pauses execution (Stop-the-World) to free memory, which is why optimizing memory usage is critical"
58,Hard,"What is ""Event Emitter"" synchronous or asynchronous","Synchronous by default. When you .emit(), all listeners are called immediately in order"
59,Hard,What is the maximum size of a single Buffer in Nod,"On 64-bit systems, it is usually 2GB"
60,Hard,What is REPL,Read-Eval-Print Loop. The interactive shell you get when you type node in the terminal
